# What is Stable+?

!!!warning **Removed**
As of version [v0.5.5](../reference/changelog.md#v055), we've decided to remove Stable+ from the Stable App. 

Stable+ was an early idea to incentivize riders to map Stables, and optionally donate a small amount of money to us to maintain the app. We found that it caused some confusion with StableCare, and was largely unused.
!!!

Stable+ is the "pro" membership within the Stable App. Stable+ Members have access to the ![](../static/icons/icon-nav-map-view.png) map view, which allows them to look for Stables that they and others have mapped.

## Stable+ Trial

When you create a new account, you are given a 31-day trial period to test out Stable+. This gives you access to all Stable+ features. As of the writing of this document, this includes:

* **Find a Stable**: A Google Map view of Posts and Stables that you can use to find secure parking.

## Renewing or Extending Stable+

Stable+ Membership costs 30 Stable Tokens. We strongly encourage riders to earn these tokens for free by:

* **Mapping Posts and Stables**: If you find a bike rack or other immovable public object intended for micromobility parking, add it to the map to earn tokens. Mapping a Stable (camera-monitored spots) earns you 5 tokens, while mapping a Post earns you 1 token.
* **Logging Parking**: Logging parking can also reward you with tokens. For the first logged parking of the month, the number of tokens you earn is high. Each additional logged parking in the month reduces the number of earned tokens. This allows riders who publicly park infrequently (once or twice a week) to earn tokens to keep their Stable+ membership free. Please refer to the [Logging Parking](../overview/logging-parking.md) page for more information.

### Buying Tokens

Users can optionally purchase tokens within the app, under the Stable+ Membership page.
