# Account Setup

After signing up, there are a few more steps to finish setting up your new account.

## Vehicle and Lock Registration

Before you are permitted to [Log Parking](logging-parking.md), you must register a vehicle and a lock. This step is important for a few key reasons.

First, if your vehicle happens to get stolen, you'll have a stored record of the vehicle information, including the vehicle's serial number and a photo of the vehicle (if you choose to provide it when registering a new vehicle). This can improve your chances at recovering the vehicle, and make it easier to notify people in your area or online community about the theft.

Second, if your vehicle happens to get stolen and you report that theft in the app, your report will help the community better understand:

- which locks are most vulnerable to theft
- which vehicles tend to be targets of theft
- what time of day thefts are most often to occur
- which areas are theft hotspots in your city

We are committed to sharing this information with the community (provided it is sufficiently anonymous and doesn't jeopardize our users' privacy) to help micromobility riders make smarter decisions about where to not park, when not to leave your vehicle unattended, which locks to avoid, and which vehicles are popular among thieves. However, we will only be able to do this if you add a vehicle and lock to your account.


### Registering your vehicle
