# Attributes

**Attributes** are details about Posts or Stables that are useful to help others find suitable parking.

Currently, the following attributes are supported:

- **Covered**: protected from rain/precipitation
- **Bike Rack**: is this a bike rack (designed specifically for small vehicle parking)?
- **Thick**: if it's too thick for a typical U-Lock, then it's considered thick (i.e., only useful for cable or chain locks).
- **Well Lit**: At night, is this spot under or near a light?
- **Bolted to the Ground**: Is the object cemented or bolted to the ground, or free-standing/movable?

## Covered

If a spot is **covered**, then it is protected from the elements. If it rains and it is possible or reasonably likely that a vehicle parked at the spot would get wet, then it is NOT covered.

This attribute is important for people who have PEVs with poor or no IP rating and want to avoid getting their vehicle wet.

## Bike Rack

Is this spot a bike rack or similar object specifically designed for bike and PEV parking? If so, then it is a bike rack. Fences, poles, lamp posts, and other objects are not bike racks.

This attribute is relevant if your city has banned locking up to objects other than bike racks.

## Thick Object

Can you fit a typical U-lock around the object? If not, then the object is **thick**. 

Many people prefer U-locks for their durability, and many theft protection policies require U-locks for insurance purposes. Thus, thicker objects like pipes and some sign posts are not suitable for those users.

## Well Lit

At night, is this spot illuminated by a nearby lamp or light? If yes, then it's well lit. We realize that this determination is somewhat subjective, so please use your best judgment.

We expect this attribute may be relevant in predicting the likelihood of theftâ€”our hypothesis being that poorly lit spots are targeted more often than well-lit spots because it is easier for a thief to hide their activity in darkness.

## Bolted to the ground

Is the object permanently fixed to the ground, either via cement, bolts, etc.? If so, then it's "bolted" to the ground. Bike racks that are cemented into a sidewalk or partially buried into the ground counts as "bolted to the ground."

This attribute is relevant to some policies that require that the object that you lock to be "immovable." Even though some free-standing bike racks are very large and difficult to move, we know that some insurers will find any way possible to get out of paying a claim. If your policy requires that your vehicle be locked to an immovable object, stick to spots that are bolted to the ground!
