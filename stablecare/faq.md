# FAQ

## Quotes

==- I filled out the online interactive form, but nothing is showing up in my email inbox. How long do I need to wait for a quote?
Our instant quoting engine automatically generates your quote and sends it to the email you entered. You should receive the mock quote within a minute or two, if not quicker.

If you don't receive the mock quote within a few minutes, check your spam folder. If it didn't show up there, just send us an email at hello@stablemobility.io and ask. We'll get it sorted out for you!

Alternatively, you can view the mock quote live in the browser, which works both on desktop and mobile devices. On the last screen of the interactive form after you submit the request for a quote, you should see a button that says "View My Quote". Just click on that, and you'll be redirected to a browser-based version of the quote. A copy of the quote will still be sent to the email you provided.

==- What's the difference between a "mock" quote and real quote?
A **mock** quote is a quote that shows you pricing and coverage options, but you can't buy StableCare from it. If you fill out the interactive form on our website, you'll receive a mock quote. You'll also receive a mock quote if you download our app and get a quote without having first registered a lock that's eligible for StableCare. Mock quotes received in the app aren't saved to your account.

A ***real*** quote is a quote that allows you can purchase a StableCare membership. If you register your vehicle and at least one lock that's eligible for StableCare (either because it's pre-approved, or because we manually approved your lock and updated your account) and then get a quote, you'll receive a real quote. This real quote is saved to your account. In addition, when viewing the quote in the app, you'll see buttons that say "Buy Now" which, if tapped, brings you to a checkout screen to complete the purchase of your StableCare membership.

!!!info What's the reason for "mock" quotes, then?
The purpose of the mock quote is to enable riders to explore coverage options without first having to provide a ton of information to us, which we would use to determine your [eligibility](eligibility.md) for StableCare. If we allowed riders to buy StableCare from a mock quote, they may not meet all of our eligiblity requirements, and we would be forced to cancel their membership and refund their purchase. By registering their vehicle and lock(s) in the app, we can determine their eligibility for StableCare, ensuring only eligible riders can actually purchase a StableCare membership.

## Locking Up

==- Why do I need an approved lock? Why can't I use any lock?
We require that you use a lock that meets a minimum level of security in order to be eligible for StableCare. 

As a general rule, we only approve locks that are resistant to attacks from hand tools, such as wire cutters and bolt cutters. Whereas almost every lock on the market can be easily cut with a cordless angle grinder (except for the Diamond-tier locks, which includes angle grinder-resistant locks from Litelok and Hiplok), many locks are difficult or impossible to cut with bolt cutters. Bolt cutter attacks can be done in broad daylight, minimally drawing attention to a thief—even on a busy street. But angle grinders are much louder and produce a lot of sparks, and are therefore much more likely to draw attention from people walking by.

Our [pre-approved lock list](https://www.stablemobility.io/locks) is primarily based around the [Sold Secure](https://www.soldsecure.com/) standard. Pre-approved StableCare Gold-tier locks are rated Sold Secure Pedal Gold, Sold Secure Pedal Diamond, or Sold Secure Powered Gold.

However, we can and do approve locks that aren't on our pre-approved list, depending on the level of security that they provide. Just drop us a note at hello@stablemobility.io and let us know what lock you have, and we'll let you know within 24 hours whether we'll approve it!

## Parking Requirements

==- Do I have to park at a Stables to receive theft protection?
**No.** Parking at stables is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> a requirement of StableCare theft protection. You can park anywhere, as long as you are able to properly lock up your vehicle to a substantially immovable object.

!!!info Why are there Stables in the app, then?
We designed our app to not only make it easy for riders to get and use StableCare theft protection, but also to be a useful tool for riders to gather evidence for their insurance claims. If you already have insurance from a speciality bicycle insurance provider, or your renter's or homeowner's insurance policy covers your vehicle, then you can still use the app to gather evidence for a potential claim by (a) logging parking to prove that you locked up, and (b) finding and parking at Stables to improve your chances at getting security video footage in the event of a theft. These are important pieces of evidence that will greatly improve your chances at getting your claim approved with whatever insurance you may have.
!!!
==- I want coverage, but I don't want to take photos (log parking). Is this really required?
We **strongly recommend** that you log parking each time that you lock up, because it unequivocally demonstrates that you locked up prior to a theft incident. But we *may* approve your claim, even if you didn't log parking, provided that you are able to procure evidence to prove that you locked up.


We ask that customers take a few seconds to log parking when they lock up and want coverage because it proves that you locked up your e-scooter or e-bike prior to a theft incident. All existing speciality bicycle insurance companies have a similar lock-up requirement, but do not have an app for gathering this evidence. As a result, when a theft occurs, the burden is on the customer to gather evidence to prove that they complied with the terms of their agreement (*i.e.*, take a photo of the broken/cut lock, send the broken lock to the insurance company, get security footage of the theft from a nearby camera, etc.).

The goal of logging parking is create **more certainty** for you in the event of a theft incident. Think of logging parking as your small contribution toward a collaborative effort to demonstrate that you locked up. If your e-scooter or e-bike gets stolen, we'll know exactly how you locked it up and will have no reason to question your story. You've helped us figure out what happened—then, we'll help you get a replacement vehicle! Without getting too philosophical, we've designed the claims process to be [collaborative, not adversarial](https://stablemobility.substack.com/p/claims-processes-should-be-cooperative).

All that being said, you *could* choose not to log parking, but be aware that we may ask you for supplemental evidence to prove that you properly locked up your e-scooter or e-bike to a substantially immovable object in the event of a theft. In our opinion, the tradeoff of taking 5-10 seconds to log parking is worth the increased certainty as to the outcome of your claim, but we know that not everyone sees it this way!

==- What happens if I forget to log parking? Does that invalidate my theft protection?
**Absolutely not!** You do not have to log parking every time you park your e-scooter or e-bike. And we know that it's easy to forget sometimes—especially if theft isn't top of mind when you park somewhere. 

**We will not penalize you** in any way for parking and not logging it—but, if you forget to log it, you won't have that key piece of evidence if your vehicle happens to get stolen that time. So we recommend making it a habit, especially if you plan to leave your vehicle unattended for longer than 5-10 minutes.

## Family Plans

==- My son or daughter rides an e-scooter and e-bike. Can I buy coverage for them?
**Absolutely!** Just send us a note at hello@stablemobility.io and briefly explain what kind of coverage you're looking for, and we'll get back to you ASAP to explain how to get your child's vehicle covered.

We have a few features planned aimed at making it easy for a parent or guardian to purchase coverage for their child's e-bike or e-scooter, including a way for the parents to view their child's parked locations. Family plan features will be released some time in Q4 2023. If you have any specific feature requests that you think would be helpful for you, we'd love to hear them! Email us at hello@stablemobility.io to share your ideas and suggestions.

==- My whole family rides micromobility vehicles. Do you offer family plans?
**Yes**, we are more than happy to work with you to get coverage for your whole family! Although it's not yet built into our app, we can manually set up billing so that your whole family can get coverage. Just reach out to us at hello@stablemobility.io and ask!

!!!info About logging parking under family plans
We understand that it may be difficult to ask for teenage children to responsibly and diligently log parking in our app when they park and lock up. As such, we do not strictly require that your children log parking in our app. However, if their e-scooter or e-bike gets stolen, we will ask for some evidence to prove that they locked up before it was stolen, using a similar process as existing speciality insurance providers.
