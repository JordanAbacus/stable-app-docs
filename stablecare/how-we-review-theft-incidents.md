# How We Review Theft Incidents

If a StableCare member falls victim to theft, the member can _activate_ their theft protection benefit. Activating your theft protection benefit is similar to filing a claim under an extended warranty or insurance policy. Once activated, we'll promptly review your theft incident to determine whether to approve or deny your theft protection benefit.

Our process for reviewing your theft incident involves a close examination of the evidence and context to determine the following:

1. Whether the member has satisfied the ***initial requirements*** for us to even review the incident.
2. Whether the **evidence** demonstrates that the member's ***lock(s) was/were defeated*** and that the member's vehicle was stolen.
3. The likelihood that the theft incident is ***legitimate*** or ***fraudulent*** based on the evidence and context.
