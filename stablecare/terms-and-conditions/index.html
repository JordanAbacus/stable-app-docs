<p>To be <strong>eligible</strong> for StableCare Membership, you must be an eligible individual, own an eligible vehicle, and use an eligible lock.</p>
<p>As used herein, the term “eligible” refers to whether a potential member qualifies to purchase StableCare.  Although Company has taken care to design the Stable App to automatically determine a potential member’s eligibility, software bugs or other unintentional design choices may, on rare occasions, allow potential members who are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> eligible for StableCare to erroneously purchase a StableCare Membership.  For this reason, Company reserves the right to cancel any StableCare Memberships if Company determines that a given Member was not in fact eligible for StableCare at the time of purchase.  In such event, Company will refund the ineligible customer.</p>

<p>Stable will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span> retroactively determine that a vehicle is ineligible.

If Company determines that a Member is not locking up properly, Company will contact the Member with additional details.</p>
<p>Ineligible vehicles are disqualified from StableCare Membership benefits. Any money paid or deposits made shall be refunded to you. A list of ineligible vehicles will be created by the Company as individuals sign up for StableCare and Stable examines whether their vehicle has the ability to be properly and adequately locked up with an eligible lock.

<p>As used herein, the term “anchor” lock refers to the primary lock or locks associated with a StableCare Membership.  Members may choose to lock up with additional locks other than their anchor lock, with no effect on their theft protection coverage under their StableCare Membership.  However, if a Member <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> lock up with such additional locks and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> with their anchor lock, their StableCare Membership will not provide theft protection for the Member’s vehicle.  For StableCare Memberships that specify two locks (<em>i.e.</em>, to receive the Alchemy discount), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> locks are considered the “anchor” lock, meaning that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> locks must be used any time the Member wishes to enjoy theft protection under their Membership.</p>
<ul>
<li>To be eligible for StableCare Gold, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Gold, Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Diamond, or Sold Secure Power Cycle Gold lock.

<li>To be eligible for StableCare Diamond, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Power Cycle Diamond. To see our approved list of locks, <a href="https://stablemobility.io/locks">click here</a>.

<li><strong>Alchemy</strong>- A member may also become eligible for StableCare Diamond with a combination of two or more locks that are eligible for StableCare Gold. Each lock must be registered in the app and applied to our quoting engine to unlock Diamond membership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The lock eligibility requirements for StableCare Community are subject to determination by the community members, and will be published with terms specific to StableCare Community before StableCare Community becomes available.</li>
<li>Individual locks may be considered eligible or ineligible for either membership on a case-by-case basis.</li>

<p>As we continue to build out our database of locks, our system may not automatically determine if your lock is eligible for the selected StableCare tier, for example due to inconsistent naming conventions for different lock manufacturers and model names.  For this reason, please check the autocomplete lock brands and model names when registering your lock.  Our database should contain every lock classified as Sold Secure Gold (Pedal), Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal), Sold Secure Gold (Powered), and Sold Secure Diamond (Powered).  If you register a lock that is not found in our database, but you believe it to be classified as one of the above Sold Secure standards, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@stablemobility.io">support@stablemobility.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> that if a lock you register is not found in our database, we will not be able to automatically determine your eligibility for StableCare, and therefore you will only be able to get a mock quote until your account has at least one StableCare-eligible lock registered thereto.</p>

        <span>StableCare Gold</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> StableCare Gold is available as an Annual, Seasonal, or Monthly Membership.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Memberships</strong> are available for riders who want coverage year-round. Coverage begins on the date of purchase and ends one (1) year later.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Memberships</strong> are available for riders who want coverage during the riding season, which is from April 1 to November 1, but don’t ride during the colder winter months. Riding season is statistically when most thefts happen, so coverage is important for riders who are worried about theft during the season. Although most thefts occur during riding season, we still offer a discount for Seasonal Memberships compared to the price for an annual membership.</p>
<p>Seasonal Memberships extend from April 1 to November 1 (the “riding season”). Seasonal Memberships purchased prior to April 1 of a given year begin on April 1 of that year. Seasonal Memberships can also be purchased mid-season between April 1 and November 1 begin on the date of purchase and expire on the following November 1. Seasonal Memberships purchased between November 1 and December 31 of a given year will begin on April 1 of the next calendar year. Seasonal Memberships purchased “mid-season” (between April 1 and November 1) receive a mid-season, pro-rated discount.</p>

<p><strong>Membership:</strong> StableCare Steel Membership is an option for riders that infrequently park their Micromobility Vehicle outside, but who may wish to enjoy theft protection benefits as part of their StableCare Membership on the rare occasions that they have to park outside. StableCare Steel Members can purchase single-use theft protection passes called Guardian Passes. Members can purchase Guardian Passes in packs of 5, 10, and 20 single-use passes. Each Guardian pass has a 12-hour time limit and cannot be used between the hours of 12am and 7am.</p>
<p><strong>One-time payments:</strong> As of the date of these Terms, StableCare Steel Membership is offered as a one-time purchase (<em>i.e.</em>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> subscriptions), with a variety of payment options available (subject to change from time to time).  Members can optionally purchase their Membership using Klarna or Affirm at checkout to pay for their StableCare Membership in installments.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Deposit:</strong> StableCare Steel requires a refundable initial deposit of 10% of the coverage amount of your Micromobility Vehicle. You can think of the refundable deposit sort of like a security deposit on a hotel room. If you don’t submit a claim and wish to cancel your coverage, we will refund you the deposit. If you submit a claim and we subsequently approve your claim, your refundable deposit will be converted to a non-refundable deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds on Canceled Memberships:</strong> Stable will have discretionary authority to refund or send a pro-rata partial refund for StableCare Membership if a Member needs to cancel their membership on good terms with Stable. If a Member’s Membership is terminated for violating these Terms (<em>e.g.</em>, for submitting a fraudulent theft claim), Company reserves the right to cancel their Membership without a refund and ban the offending user from the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Lock Requirement:</strong> To be eligible for StableCare Steel, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Gold. Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Diamond, Sold Secure Power Cycle Gold, and Sold Secure Power Cycle Diamond locks are all eligible for StableCare Steel. To see our approved list of locks, <a href="https://stablemobility.io/locks">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Company may deem individual locks as either eligible or ineligible on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> StableCare Steel Memberships begin on the date of purchase, effective immediately after payment is completed.  StableCare Steel Membership is perpetual, lasting until either the Member submits a theft claim or cancels their Membership and receives a refund of their initial deposit. StableCare Steel Members can purchase additional Guardian Passes at any time as long as their Steel Membership is active. Some Membership benefits, such as the ability to submit reviewable theft claims, does not begin until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items are completed.</p>

<p>For riders with multiple Micromobility Vehicles, we offer discounted StableCare plans for each additional vehicle after the first vehicle. The amount of the discount is based on the rider&#x27;s use case, and is subject to change over time.</p>
<p>If the rider owns multiple vehicles and only rides, locks up, and parks one of them away from home at a time, then we offer substantially discounted StableCare plans for each additional vehicle. By default, the multi-vehicle discounts will be applied to the lower-valued vehicles. For example, the Member owns a $3,000 e-scooter and a $1,000 e-scooter, the multi-vehicle discount will be applied to the $1,000 e-scooter.</p>

<p>In contrast, a keyed- or NFC-based ignition system is much more convenient to use, and so we expect that you&#x27;ll use this such an anti-theft feature regularly.</p>

<p>The fact that we only cover one vehicle parked away from home at a time is the reason that we can offer the multi-vehicle discount. Since only one vehicle can be stolen away from home at a time, the only compounding risk is theft that occurs at home.

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The enumerated steps below outline the basic process of becoming a StableCare Member:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Stable App (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stablemobility.stableapp">Get it on Google Play</a>, or on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stable-pev-theft-protection/id6446907426">Apple App Store</a>).</li>
<li>Within the Stable App, <a href="https://docs.stablemobility.io/overview/account-registration/">create a new account</a>, or login to your existing Stable account.</li>
<li>Follow these <a href="https://docs.stablemobility.io/overview/account-setup/">account setup</a> steps to register your vehicle and your lock to your Stable account.</li>
<li>To sign up for Membership, navigate to the StableCare tab on the navigation bar. <strong>Note:</strong> You must register a vehicle and lock before you can create a quote. Next, select the vehicle you wish to add coverage to, and the anchor lock(s) that you wish to pair with the coverage.
<ol type="a">
<li>You can register an alarm to receive an additional 5% discount on your quote.</li>
<li>If you were sent a referral code by another member, you can apply it when generating a quote for 10% off your membership. You cannot generate a referral code for your own quote, but if you refer other Members with your code, you will receive a $50 gift card for each referral that joins StableCare.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You will be presented with a quote containing multiple StableCare Membership options to select from, depending on the lock(s) you input when generating a quote. Until further notice, all quotes will be provided in United States Dollars only (<em>i.e.</em>, not available in other currencies).  If you are not eligible for StableCare Diamond membership, you will still see a Diamond membership option, but it will be crossed out and unavailable to select.
<ol type="a">
<li>You will be presented with three Membership durations, including Annual, Seasonal, or Passes.
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>Annual</strong>: Annual Membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts for a year from that date.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal:</strong> Seasonal membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts through November 1 of that year.  Seasonal Membership quotes are prorated from the date of a quote, meaning the prices may change depending on how much time is left in the season.</li>
<li><strong>Passes:</strong> Members can purchase single-use theft protection passes, or “Guardian Passes,” which can be purchased in packs of 5, 10, or 20, along with a StableCare Steel Membership.  Guardian Passes are designed to provide affordable theft protection for riders who infrequently need theft protection, such as riders who typically bring their ride inside wherever they go.  StableCare Steel Members must provide a refundable deposit to become a Member, which is automatically added as a line item to your invoice when you select a Guardian Pass pack.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Upon selecting your preferred StableCare tier* and duration, you will be directed to a checkout page on Stripe where you will make a one-time payment for the full length of the Membership tier you selected. You will have the option at checkout to pay in installments with Klarna or Affirm. Please complete the checkout process.</li>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Once you’ve paid for your StableCare Membership, you will be redirected to the app where you can view and manage your Membership, and/or use other features of the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Immediately after your Membership is created, your Membership will be considered “incomplete.”</strong>  Although Members can immediately enjoy theft protection after becoming a Member, Members cannot submit a <em>reviewable</em> theft claim under their Membership until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items have been completed.  While we ask that Members complete these action items in a timely manner, the Member can decide if and when they choose to complete them.  For example, if the Member wants to preserve their privacy, they can choose not to complete the Account Verification process unless and until they need to file a theft claim.</p>
<p>However, some of the action items may be difficult or impossible to complete after a theft incident, which if left incomplete would therefore make it effectively impossible for the Member to file a reviewable theft claim.  For instance, the serial number for your vehicle associated with your Membership must be provided prior to submitting a theft claim.  If you do not have a photo or other copy of the serial number of your vehicle, and it is stolen before you add the serial number to your Membership, then Company reserves the right to deny your claim.  Company has designed the Stable App to provide ample reminders to Members with incomplete Memberships, and encourages all Members to complete their Memberships soon after becoming a StableCare Member.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>You will need to complete the following before you can submit a reviewable theft claim.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will need to review and agree to the Terms and Conditions by checking a box and providing your signature in the Agree to Terms card on the screen.</li>
<li>You will need to Upload Proof of Purchase documentation for at least the vehicle covered under your Membership.  We may also ask you to provide receipt(s) for your lock(s) and/or alarm (if you have one) by contacting you via email if Company deems it necessary to verify the coverage amount.</li>
<li>You will also need to provide your vehicle Serial Number if you have not already done so when registering your vehicle. This can be done at any time, but we recommend doing so right away, as it may be difficult or impossible to do if and after your vehicle gets stolen.</li>
<li>Upload an image of your lock(s) if you did not already do so when registering your lock.</li>

            <h5>What happens if you forget to log parking?</h5>
<p>If the Member does not log parking during a parking session and the Member&#x27;s Micromobility Vehicle is subsequently stolen, Stable will likely deny Member&#x27;s theft claim unless the Member can procure additional evidence to prove (1) that the vehicle was properly lock to a substantially immovable object, and (2) that the vehicle was stolen.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Regularly forgetting to log parking in the app may adversely impact your likelihood of getting a theft claim approved, especially if a theft incident occurs during a parking session which the Member didn&#x27;t log parking. Because your Micromobility Vehicle could get stolen during any parking session, we highly encourage all Members to log parking each and every time they park and lock up.</p>

            <h5>Logging Parking at Home</h5>
<p>If a Member parks their vehicle at home in a <doc-anchor-trigger to="#definition-publicly-accessible">publicly accessible</doc-anchor-trigger> <doc-anchor-trigger to="#definition-non-living-space">non-living space</doc-anchor-trigger>, such as a patio, front yard, back yard, or common areas in an apartment or condo building, the Member must lock up their vehicle and log parking in order to be covered for theft under their StableCare Membership. If the area is monitored by a security camera and the Member has access to getting security video footage from it, the Member does not have to log parking at home, and can instead obtain and share the security footage in the event of a theft.</p>
<p>If a Member parks their vehicle at home in a <doc-anchor-trigger to="#definition-not-publicly-accessible">non-publicly accessible</doc-anchor-trigger> non-living space, such as a private garage with all entryways shut and locked, then the Member does not need to lock up and, in turn, does not need to log parking. In the event of a theft of a Member&#x27;s non-locked vehicle in a non-publicly accessible non-living space, Stable will likely request Member to provide photographic evidence of forcible entry, such as a broken door, shattered window, or other signs of forcible entry. In addition, the description that Member files in the police report must include details about the breaking-and-entering that occurred.</p>

        <span>Filing a Claim</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If you fall victim to theft during the course of your Membership, you can submit a theft claim to Company to request replacement/reimbursement for your stolen vehicle and/or other covered items, if applicable.</p>
<p>The moment you discover your vehicle has been stolen, open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab. Select the StableCare Membership you wish to submit the claim under, and then tap on the “Submit Claim” button underneath your Membership card. You will be asked to provide a brief written description of the theft incident.  If you have already filed a police report (not required to file the initial claim), you may specify that you did and upload a copy of it immediately.  If not, you can simply submit the written description to create a new claim in our system.  We will not review your claim until you have uploaded a copy of the police report and have completed all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items, if any.</p>
<p>During our review, we may ask you to provide additional information or evidence.  In such an event, Company shall contact the Member via email.  Alternatively, Member can submit additional evidence for their claim to <a href="mailto:claims@stablemobility.io">claims@stablemobility.io</a> at any time during the review process, and/or by uploading image/video evidence within the Stable App under their Membership Details page. Please provide a copy of your Membership ID when sending us additional evidence via email so that we can match it against your theft claim.</p>
<p>After creating a claim, we may send you an email with additional steps or request additional information from you.</p>
<p>Before or after submitting a claim, we strongly recommend that you gather additional evidence about the theft incident to help prove your case. Other than filing a detailed police report and providing us with a copy of that police report, the additional evidence described below is not required. However, each piece of evidence will significantly improve your chances at your claim being approved. In the following sections, we outline some evidence you should consider gathering in the event that your vehicle is stolen for each scenario that is covered under your StableCare Membership.</p>

    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Soon after you discover that your vehicle was stolen, you should gather evidence about the incident in support of your claim, which can substantially improve your chances at your claim being approved.  Here are some steps we recommend that you follow immediately after discovering the theft:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take photos</strong> of the &quot;crime scene,&quot; or the place where you locked up your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Look around for the defeated lock.</strong> It is likely that the thief ditched it nearby.</li>
<li>If you found the lock, <strong>take photos of the defeated lock</strong> as you found it, followed by close-ups of the lock showing how it was defeated (cut, picked, etc.).</li>
<li>If you found the lock, <strong>take it with you</strong> (all of the pieces)! It is valuable proof that you may need in the future and that we may ask you about during the claim process.</li>
<li><strong>Look around for any nearby security cameras</strong>, and take photos of them and note the building addresses and/or business names that appear to be in control of those cameras.</li>
<li><strong>File a police report</strong>, and make sure you get a copy of it. Many large cities have a way to file these reports online. If yours doesn&#x27;t, call the non-emergency number for your local police and ask them to file a report for your stolen vehicle.
<ol type="a">
<li>When filing the police report, ask the police if they can help request camera footage of the theft from any nearby cameras, especially cameras that are controlled by the city.</li>
</ol>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The sooner you file the police report, the more likely they are to try and recover the vehicle—especially if you have a tracking device on the vehicle. Most police officers will tell you that there&#x27;s not much they can do if the report filed the next day, as many thieves will bring the vehicle to a chop shop or will have sold it by then.</p>

    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Soon after you discover that your vehicle was stolen, we highly encourage you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ensure that your Membership is complete with all information about your vehicle, lock(s), alarm (if applicable) being registered to your Membership.  If you do not see any outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items on your Membership, then you should be all set!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you found any security cameras near the location of the theft, try to get video footage of the theft. Call the business(es) and/or visit them in person.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Enter the building that appears to be in control of the cameras and ask to speak with security personnel if there are any on site, or with the building/property manager. If the building is occupied by a business, ask to speak to the manager or owner of the business. If you are successful in getting into contact with someone who has access to the security camera footage, proceed to ask them the following questions in (b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you confirm if your security cameras are pointed at the bike racks?</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer is yes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I just had my vehicle stolen from the [area your vehicle was locked in] that has a camera pointed at it.</em> Show the email you received of your logged parking with time and location information and the theft report timecard email to prove the time window your vehicle was stolen in. Bring your copy of the police report as well, and if the police agreed to help attempt to get video footage, set up a time to bring the police with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then say the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have theft protection with a company called Stable, and they require video evidence of the theft if it’s available. I’m also filing a police report of the theft and the camera footage will help the police create a profile of the suspect and possibly be able to identify them and try to arrest them. Are you willing to share footage from those cameras with me? The footage can be recorded through my phone on one of your monitors to make it easy for you.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they are willing to provide access to the footage, this will greatly improve the speed with which your claim gets processed and the likelihood of approval. If they are unwilling to provide access or if they are unable to, explain the reason they give you in an email to us with your claim number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reply to the claim email you received from us with all of the information you gathered above, including any explanations you have regarding information you were unable to gather (thief didn’t leave the lock behind, video footage was not granted, etc.). This is your chance to give us as much context as you can. Expect that we may ask additional questions, may call you to interview you, and/or may request that you provide additional information on a case-by-case basis. If needed, we will send you a secure upload link to upload any documentation and files that you have that are too large to send via email.</p>

<p>Gathering evidence from cameras monitoring the area and obtaining a video recording of the theft, if possible, is strongly recommended for the success of your claim—especially if you are a new Member with little to no activity history within the Stable App. If there are cameras present, but you are unsuccessful in obtaining a video recording of the theft, or if the theft was not actually in the frame of a camera, we may ask that you describe your attempt to obtain the footage.

    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To submit a theft replacement/reimbursement claim for your vehicle in the event of a robbery, where your vehicle was physically taken from you by force or the threat of force, the following steps should be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immediate Safety Actions:</strong> Ensure you are safe, away from immediate danger, and if you are not, prioritize your safety and leave the area as quickly as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Contact the Police:</strong> As soon as it&#x27;s safe to do so, contact your local police to report the robbery. Robbery is a much more serious crime than ordinary theft, with a much more severe punishment for the criminal due to the use of force or threat of use of force. For this reason, provide the police with as much detail as possible including the description of the suspect, any vehicles the suspect used (including license plate, vehicle make, model, etc.), any descriptive characteristics of any accomplices involved, and any other relevant details that could help the police detain the criminal and recover the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a Police Report:</strong> After reporting the incident, request an official copy of the police report. This will be necessary to submit your claim. Ensure that the report includes all details you provided.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> If you still have access to your phone and the Stable App after the robbery, open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab. Select the StableCare Membership you wish to submit the claim under, and then tap on the “Submit Claim” button underneath your Membership card.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be asked to provide a brief written description of the theft incident.  If you have already filed a police report and have obtained a copy (not required to file the initial claim), you may specify that you did and upload a copy of it immediately.  If not, you can simply submit the written description to create a new claim in our system.  We will not review your claim until you have uploaded a copy of the police report and have completed all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items, if any.</p>
<p>If your phone was stolen from you during the Robbery and you do not have access to the Stable App, please let us know by reaching out to us at <a href="mailto:claims@stablemobility.io">claims@stablemobility.io</a> and detailing the robbery and the fact that your phone was also taken, making the it impossible for you to start a claim immediately after the robbery. We will do our best to process the claim outside of the app and to communicate all steps of the claim process via email and/or other means of communication.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>It is highly encouraged for you to use a wearable camera device such as a GoPro or similar recording device to record video footage of your rides so that you can have evidence of any incidents you experience.  Any video footage which records the incident of a robbery can be used as evidence for the police in their investigation and for your claim submission. Video evidence provides irrefutable evidence and will offer substantial weight to the approval of your claim. We will do our best to take all evidence into account when we make a decision to approve or deny your claim, and we have a primary focus to protect the Company and other Members against fraudulent claims, enabling us to bring theft protection to our Members.</p>

<p>We recommend that you gather all the necessary documentation for your claim, which should include the police report, any video footage you captured, photos of the area where the theft occurred, and any other relevant evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Within a day or two after you are robbed</strong>, we highly encourage that you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that your Membership is complete with all information about your vehicle, lock(s), alarm (if applicable) being registered to your Membership.  If you do not see any outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items on your Membership, then you should be all set!</li>
<li>If you found any security cameras near the location of the robbery, try to get video footage of the robbery. Call the business(es) and/or visit them in person. Refer to the steps above for a theft for more specific details to recover video evidence.</li>
<li>Reply to the claim email you received from us with all of the information you gathered above, including any explanations you have regarding information you were unable to gather (GoPro was taken from you, phone was taken from you, video footage was not granted, etc.). This is your chance to give us as much context as you can. Expect that we may ask additional questions, may call you to interview you, and/or may request that you provide additional information on a case-by-case basis. If needed, we will send you a secure upload link to upload any documentation and files that you have that are too large to send via email, including video and image files.</li>

<p>StableCare only provides theft protection for your covered vehicle at this time.  StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover any wear-and-tear, damage (including due to battery fires), defects, electrical issues, accidents, medical bills, or other kinds of liability coverage.</p>
<p>With respect to theft incidents, StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is stolen while parked and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> locked up, except when the vehicle is secured at home in either the Member&#x27;s living space or stored inside the Member&#x27;s non-publicly accessible non-living space.</p>
<p>Unless an explicit written exception is granted, StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is lent to a friend, family member, or other third party; in other words, coverage is only provided for the specific combination of Member, covered vehicle, and anchor lock(s).</p>
<p>StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is improperly locked, such that the thief stole the vehicle without having to cut, pick, or otherwise defeat the lock with tools.  StableCare may cover theft scenarios where the thief damaged the object to which the vehicle was locked on a case-by-case basis. StableCare may also cover theft scenarios where the thief damaged the vehicle itself in order to free it from the lock.</p>
<p>StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where theft was achieved through the minor disassembly of the vehicle (<em>e.g.</em>, when the lock is secured to the stem of a scooter and the thief removed the handle bars and slid the stem out of the lock).  If a thief can relatively easily disassemble parts of the vehicle to separate the vehicle from the lock, the lock-up is considered improper and therefore is not covered by StableCare, with exceptions made by the Company on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h5>What&#x27;s the difference between a minor disassembly and a major disassembly?</h5>
<p>If common tools (e.g., flathead screwdriver, philips screwdriver, hex wrench, adjustable wrench, etc.) can be used to disassemble parts of your vehicle within a reasonably short amount of time (e.g., under 5 minutes), such that a thief could free the vehicle from the lock, then such disassembly shall be deemed <strong>minor</strong>.</p>
<p>If specialized tools (e.g., security screwdriver, power tools, etc.) are required to disassemble parts of your vehicle such that a thief could free the vehicle from the lock, then such disassembly shall be deemed <strong>major</strong>.</p>
<p>Although Company will endeavour to extend coverage to all cases in which thieves disassemble parts of the vehicle, the onus is on the Member to understand how their vehicle&#x27;s construction and determine which lock-up configurations could be overcome through minor vehicle disassembly. For example, many handlebar assemblies on e-scooters are secured to the stem with a few bolts or screws. If the handlebar assembly can be easily removed with common tools, then securing a lock around the e-scooter&#x27;s stem is highly discouraged.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>If you are unwilling, unable, or otherwise do not file a police report with details about the theft incident to your local police, Company will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover your claim, absent extraordinary circumstances reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Filing a police report is essential to reducing the risk of fraud to Company, and anyone who files a false police report is committing a felony and subjecting themselves to potential fines or imprisonment.  Anyone who has had their vehicle legitimately stolen should file a police report, regardless of whether they have StableCare theft protection or not.</p>
<p>If the stolen vehicle is recovered before your claim is processed, the replacement/reimbursement might be void or adjusted based on the condition of the recovered vehicle.</p>
<p>If your claim is denied, you may appeal our decision if it is due to the suspicion of fraud. You will be required to submit evidence which supports your case against the suspicion of fraud. We commit to being thorough, transparent, expedient, and fair throughout the claims process and will do our best to consider all additional evidence provided to us. Our goal is not to deny legitimate claims of our Members, but to protect against fraudulent claims, which put the Company and our other Members at risk.</p>
