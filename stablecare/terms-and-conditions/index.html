<p>StableCare is <strong>NOT</strong> micromobility vehicle insurance and shall not in any way be considered as such.  StableCare Memberships provide for multiple benefits to StableCare Members (“Members” or “Customers”), which includes theft protection that covers the Member’s properly registered Micromobility Vehicle (“Vehicle”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.</p>
<p>StableCare offers theft reimbursement as one of a series of Membership benefits, via the Stable App for eligible Members who have properly registered eligible Micromobility Vehicle(s) and eligible anchor lock(s), which theft is caused by a defeated lock, whether it is picked, cut, or destroyed with the use of any tools.</p>

<p><strong>Value of elected coverage:</strong> If the registered micromobility vehicle is stolen because of the malicious or unintended opening or breaking of the eligible lock by force, Stable will send you a replacement vehicle or a gift card in the amount equivalent to the coverage amount you select when enrolling in StableCare.</p>
<p>The coverage amount cannot be greater than the total cost of your vehicle, lock, and accessories, and you must provide receipts proving the cost of each should you elect to receive coverage for them.</p>
<p>If you purchased a used vehicle, you must show evidence of how much you paid for the vehicle, whether in the form of a bank transaction, Venmo, Zelle, or other form of electronic payment. We cannot offer coverage for a vehicle paid for in cash which has no record or proof of payment.</p>
<p><strong>Value of Uber or Lyft ride home:</strong> A special benefit of StableCare Membership includes the value of an Uber or Lyft ride home. It’s bad enough that your ride was stolen. You still need to get home, and we will reimburse StableCare Members for that ride. Just email us a copy of your trip receipt and we’ll take care of it.</p>

<p>To be <strong>eligible</strong> for StableCare Membership, you must be an eligible individual, own an eligible vehicle, and use an eligible lock.</p>
<p>As used herein, the term “eligible” refers to whether a potential member qualifies to purchase StableCare.  Although Company has taken care to design the Stable App to automatically determine a potential member’s eligibility, software bugs or other unintentional design choices may, on rare occasions, allow potential members who are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> eligible for StableCare to erroneously purchase a StableCare Membership.  For this reason, Company reserves the right to cancel any StableCare Memberships if Company determines that a given Member was not in fact eligible for StableCare at the time of purchase.  In such event, Company will refund the ineligible customer.</p>

<li>permanently live in a city and country that the Company has deemed eligible;

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If there is no way to properly secure a vehicle to an immovable, affixed object using an eligible lock due to the design of the e-scooter or e-bike not allowing it or due to the ability of a thief to use common tools to disassemble parts of the e-scooter or e-bike that the lock would attach to, the vehicle will be deemed an ineligible vehicle.</p>
<p>Because Micromobility Vehicles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and form factors, Company reserves the right to ask individual Members to demonstrate proper lock-up of their vehicle at any point during the duration of their Membership.  Company may also review logged parking photos taken by Members at random to verify that Members are consistently performing proper lock-up.  If Company determines that a Member is not locking up properly, Company will contact the Member with additional details.</p>
<p>Ineligible vehicles are disqualified from StableCare Membership benefits. Any money paid or deposits made shall be refunded to you. A list of ineligible vehicles will be created by the Company as individuals sign up for StableCare and Stable examines whether their vehicle has the ability to be properly and adequately locked up with an eligible lock. The Company reserves the right to update this list from time to time.</p>

Members may choose to lock up with additional locks other than their anchor lock, with no effect on their theft protection coverage under their StableCare Membership.  However, if a Member <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> lock up with such additional locks and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> with their anchor lock, their StableCare Membership will not provide theft protection for the Member’s vehicle.  For StableCare Memberships that specify two locks (<em>i.e.</em>, to receive the Alchemy discount), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> locks are considered the “anchor” lock, meaning that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span> locks must be used any time the Member wishes to enjoy theft protection under their Membership.</p>
<ul>

<p>As we continue to build out our database of locks, our system may not automatically determine if your lock is eligible for the selected StableCare tier, for example due to inconsistent naming conventions for different lock manufacturers and model names.  For this reason, please check the autocomplete lock brands and model names when registering your lock.  Our database should contain every lock classified as Sold Secure Gold (Pedal), Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal), Sold Secure Gold (Powered), and Sold Secure Diamond (Powered).  If you register a lock that is not found in our database, but you believe it to be classified as one of the above Sold Secure standards, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@stablemobility.io">support@stablemobility.io</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> that if a lock you register is not found in our database, we will not be able to automatically determine your eligibility for StableCare, and therefore you will only be able to get a mock quote until your account has at least one StableCare-eligible lock registered thereto.</p>

        <span>StableCare Tiers and Fee Structure</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>There are three different StableCare Tiers that each have different impacts on fees and requirements, which are described in more detail below.</p>

    <h3>
        <doc-anchor-trigger class="header-anchor-trigger" to="#stablecare-gold">#</doc-anchor-trigger>
        <span>StableCare Gold</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> StableCare Gold is available as an Annual or Seasonal Membership.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Memberships</strong> are available for riders who want coverage year-round. Coverage begins on the date of purchase and ends one (1) year later.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Memberships</strong> are charged for riders who want coverage during the riding season, which is from April 1 to November 1, but don’t ride during the colder winter months. Riding season is statistically when most thefts happen, so coverage is important for riders who are worried about theft during the season. Although most thefts occur during riding season, we still offer a discount for Seasonal Memberships compared to the price for an annual membership.</p>
<p>Seasonal Memberships extend from April 1 to November 1 (the “riding season”).  Seasonal Memberships purchased prior to April 1 of a given year begin on April 1 of that year.  Seasonal Memberships can also be purchased mid-season between April 1 and November 1 begin on the date of purchase and expire on the following November 1.  Seasonal Memberships purchased between November 1 and December 31 of a given year will begin on April 1 of the next calendar year.  Seasonal Memberships purchased “mid-season” (between April 1 and November 1) receive a mid-season, pro-rated discount.</p>
<p><strong>One-time payments:</strong> As of the date of these Terms, both Annual and Seasonal Memberships are offered as one-time purchases (<em>i.e.</em>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> subscriptions), with a variety of payment options available (subject to change from time to time).  Members can optionally purchase their Membership using Klarna or Affirm at checkout to pay for their StableCare Membership in installments.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity and Privacy:</strong> In the interest of cybersecurity best practices and user privacy, Stable does not store any payment information in our systems.</p>
<p><strong>Membership Dividends:</strong> From time-to-time, or at the end of a Membership cycle, StableCare Gold Members may receive a partial refund of their Membership fee, which we refer to as the “Membership Dividend.”  If Members take precautionary measures to reduce their risk of theft, and therefore fewer theft claims are filed than expected, Company commits to returning excess profits to the Members in the form of this Membership Dividend.  Company reserves the right to determine the appropriate mechanism for distributing any Membership Dividends to the members, which may include one or more of the following: partial refunds back to each Members’ original payment method, Visa gift cards, Amazon gift cards, and/or other discounts toward a future StableCare Membership and/or other Stable products and services.  Members are not entitled to the Membership Dividend, nor should they reasonably expect to receive it; the Membership Dividend is offered at Company’s sole discretion, consistent with our mission to encourage micromobility vehicle owners to replace car trips with micromobility trips.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds on Canceled Memberships:</strong> Stable will have discretionary authority to refund or send a pro-rata partial refund for StableCare Membership if a Member needs to cancel their membership on good terms with Stable. If a Member’s Membership is terminated for violating these Terms (<em>e.g.</em>, for submitting a fraudulent theft claim), Company reserves the right to cancel their Membership without a refund and ban the offending user from the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Lock Requirement:</strong> To be eligible for StableCare Gold, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Gold, Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Diamond, or Sold Secure Power Cycle Gold lock. To see our approved list of locks, <a href="https://stablemobility.io/locks">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Company may deem individual locks as either eligible or ineligible on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> StableCare Gold Memberships begin on the date of purchase, effective immediately after payment is completed.  The start and end dates of your StableCare Membership can be viewed within the Stable App. Some Membership benefits, such as the ability to submit reviewable theft claims, does not begin until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items are completed.</p>

        <span>StableCare Steel</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong> StableCare Steel Membership is an option for riders that infrequently park their Micromobility Vehicle outside, but who may wish to enjoy theft protection benefits as part of their StableCare Membership on the rare occasions that they have to park outside. StableCare Steel Members can purchase single-use theft protection passes called Guardian Passes. Members can purchase Guardian Passes in packs of 5, 10, and 20 single-use passes. Each Guardian pass has a 12-hour time limit and cannot be used between the hours of 12am and 7am.</p>
<p><strong>One-time payments:</strong> As of the date of these Terms, StableCare Steel Membership is offered as a one-time purchase (<em>i.e.</em>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> subscriptions), with a variety of payment options available (subject to change from time to time).  Members can optionally purchase their Membership using Klarna or Affirm at checkout to pay for their StableCare Membership in installments.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Deposit:</strong> StableCare Steel requires a refundable initial deposit of 10% of the coverage amount of your Micromobility Vehicle. You can think of the refundable deposit sort of like a security deposit on a hotel room. If you don’t submit a claim and wish to cancel your coverage, we will refund you the deposit. If you submit a claim and we subsequently approve your claim, your refundable deposit will be converted to a non-refundable deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds on Canceled Memberships:</strong> Stable will have discretionary authority to refund or send a pro-rata partial refund for StableCare Membership if a Member needs to cancel their membership on good terms with Stable. If a Member’s Membership is terminated for violating these Terms (<em>e.g.</em>, for submitting a fraudulent theft claim), Company reserves the right to cancel their Membership without a refund and ban the offending user from the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Lock Requirement:</strong> To be eligible for StableCare Steel, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Gold. Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Diamond, Sold Secure Power Cycle Gold, and Sold Secure Power Cycle Diamond locks are all eligible for StableCare Steel. To see our approved list of locks, <a href="https://stablemobility.io/locks">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Company may deem individual locks as either eligible or ineligible on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> StableCare Steel Memberships begin on the date of purchase, effective immediately after payment is completed.  StableCare Steel Membership is perpetual, lasting until either the Member submits a theft claim or cancels their Membership and receives a refund of their initial deposit. StableCare Steel Members can purchase additional Guardian Passes at any time as long as their Steel Membership is active. Some Membership benefits, such as the ability to submit reviewable theft claims, does not begin until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items are completed.</p>

<p><strong>Referral Codes:</strong> Members who enter a referral code sent to them by another member will receive a 10% discount for their StableCare Membership fee. Members cannot use their own referral code for a 10% discount on their own membership.

        <span>How to Become a StableCare Member</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The enumerated steps below outline the basic process of becoming a StableCare Member:</p>
<ol class="contains-task-list">
<li>Download the Stable App (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stablemobility.stableapp">Get it on Google Play</a>, or on<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/QAQbQUpP"> Apple TestFlight</a>).</li>
<li>Within the Stable App,<a href="https://docs.stablemobility.io/overview/account-registration/"> create a new account</a>, or login to your existing Stable account.</li>
<li>Follow these<a href="https://docs.stablemobility.io/overview/account-setup/"> account setup</a> steps to register your vehicle and your lock to your Stable account.</li>
<li class="task-list-item">To sign up for Membership, navigate to the<input disabled="disabled" type="checkbox" />(<a href="https://stablemobility.io/stablecare">https://stablemobility.io/stablecare</a>)StableCare icon on the navigation bar. <strong>Note:</strong> You must register a vehicle and lock before you can create a quote. Next, select the vehicle you wish to add coverage to, and the anchor lock(s) that you wish to pair with the coverage.
<ol type="a">
<li>You can register an alarm to receive an additional 5% discount on your quote.</li>
<li>If you were sent a referral code by another member, you can apply it when generating a quote for 10% off your membership. You cannot generate a referral code for your own quote, but if you refer other Members with your code, you will receive a $50 gift card for each referral that joins StableCare.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You will be presented with a quote containing multiple StableCare Membership options to select from, depending on the lock(s) you input when generating a quote. Until further notice, all quotes will be provided in United States Dollars only (<em>i.e.</em>, not available in other currencies).  If you are not eligible for StableCare Diamond membership, you will still see a Diamond membership option, but it will be crossed out and unavailable to select.
<ol type="a">
<li>You will be presented with three Membership durations, including Annual, Seasonal, or Passes.
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>Annual</strong>: Annual Membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts for a year from that date.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal:</strong> Seasonal membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts through November 1 of that year.  Seasonal Membership quotes are prorated from the date of a quote, meaning the prices may change depending on how much time is left in the season.</li>
<li><strong>Passes:</strong> Members can purchase single-use theft protection passes, or “Guardian Passes,” which can be purchased in packs of 5, 10, or 20, along with a StableCare Steel Membership.  Guardian Passes are designed to provide affordable theft protection for riders who infrequently need theft protection, such as riders who typically bring their ride inside wherever they go.  StableCare Steel Members must provide a refundable deposit to become a Member, which is automatically added as a line item to your invoice when you select a Guardian Pass pack.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Upon selecting your preferred StableCare tier* and duration, you will be directed to a checkout page on Stripe where you will make a one-time payment for the full length of the Membership tier you selected. You will have the option at checkout to pay in installments with Klarna or Affirm. Please complete the checkout process.</li>
</ol>

        <span>After you’ve become a StableCare Member</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Once you’ve paid for your StableCare Membership, you will be redirected to the app where you can view and manage your Membership, and/or use other features of the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Immediately after your Membership is created, your Membership will be considered “incomplete.”</strong>  Although Members can immediately enjoy theft protection after becoming a Member, Members cannot submit a <em>reviewable</em> theft claim under their Membership until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items have been completed.  While we ask that Members complete these action items in a timely manner, the Member can decide if and when they choose to complete them.  For example, if the Member wants to preserve their privacy, they can choose not to complete the Account Verification process unless and until they need to file a theft claim.</p>
<p>However, some of the action items may be difficult or impossible to complete after a theft incident, which if left incomplete would therefore make it effectively impossible for the Member to file a reviewable theft claim.  For instance, the serial number for your vehicle associated with your Membership must be provided prior to submitting a theft claim.  If you do not have a photo or other copy of the serial number of your vehicle, and it is stolen before you add the serial number to your Membership, then Company reserves the right to deny your claim.  Company has designed the Stable App to provide ample reminders to Members with incomplete Memberships, and encourages all Members to complete their Memberships soon after becoming a StableCare Member.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>You will need to complete the following before you can submit a reviewable theft claim.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will need to review and agree to the Terms and Conditions by checking a box and providing your signature in the Agree to Terms card on the screen.</li>
<li>You will need to Upload Proof of Purchase documentation for at least the vehicle covered under your Membership.  We may also ask you to provide receipt(s) for your lock(s) and/or alarm (if you have one) by contacting you via email if Company deems it necessary to verify the coverage amount.</li>
<li>You will also need to provide your vehicle Serial Number if you have not already done so when registering your vehicle. This can be done at any time, but we recommend doing so right away, as it may be difficult or impossible to do if and after your vehicle gets stolen.</li>
<li>Upload an image of your lock(s) if you did not already do so when registering your lock.</li>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>As part of StableCare Membership, you are required to <a href="https://docs.stablemobility.io/overview/logging-parking/">log parking</a> every time you lock your Micromobility Vehicle using the Stable App. Members are required to select their Membership when logging parking (which should occur automatically) to enjoy theft protection during that parking session.  If Company discovers that a Member frequently parks without logging parking, Company may view such activity with suspicion, which may adversely impact the Member’s chances at having a future theft claim approved.  For this reason, we highly encourage all Members to log parking each and every time that they lock up.</p>

You can verify your identity in the Stable App by visiting the Account tab and selecting the &quot;Verify Identity&quot; card. You will be guided through a process that includes phone verification, verifying a state-issued identification card, taking a self portrait, answering a few questions about your criminal history (if any), and asking you to sign an attestation.</p>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The following section describes a set of best practices that we highly encourage each Member to follow. Because StableCare is not insurance, the Company reserves the right to refuse claims that are submitted by members that are deemed fraudulent, dubious, or otherwise dishonest. To <strong><em>increase</em></strong> the likelihood that your claim is approved, we recommend that you adhere to the following practices.</p>
<doc-anchor-target id="always-log-parking">

        <span>Always Log Parking</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>When you submit your claim, we first check to see if you satisfied all of the basic requirements. The first of these requirements is that you logged parking prior to the theft. Of course, this means that you <strong><em>could</em></strong> choose not to log parking sometimes, perhaps because you believe the risk to be low, because you’re in a hurry, or because you simply forgot. Because a thief can steal your vehicle any time you park, we strongly encourage that all members log parking <strong>every time they park</strong>. By making logging parking habitual, you ensure that you have at least satisfied this basic requirement if you become the unfortunate victim of theft.</p>

        <span>Park at Stables as Much As Possible</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The most irrefutable evidence of theft is video footage of the theft occurring. Parking at Stables (that is, camera-monitored spots) increases the chance that you can obtain this video footage. For claims that appear suspicious—such as those filed soon after a member joins, or where the context of the situation is otherwise unusual or indicative of a potential fraudulent claim—security camera footage can be very convincing evidence that makes it significantly easier for the Company to approve of your claim. Moreover, thieves are less likely to commit crimes in camera-monitored areas, so parking at Stables should reduce the chance you’ll even fall victim to theft in the first place.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If Stables are safer, more secure parking spots for micromobility vehicles, then we should discover and share them with others in the community. Members that map Stables are actively giving back to the micromobility community, and doing their part to encourage riders to replace more car trips with micromobility trips. When we process a claim, we examine how many Stables the member has mapped—and thereby consider how much this member has contributed to the micromobility community. Doing so is not required to be a StableCare Member, but members who actively map Stables will be considered with greater deference than members who don’t map Stables. Think of this like positive karma for contributing to the community. As an added bonus, you’ll be able to use Stable Tokens awarded for mapping Stables for various prizes and be entered into raffles!</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If a thief is deciding which vehicle to steal, they will likely target whichever vehicle is easiest to steal. Using two or more locks—especially when parking in riskier areas—should significantly reduce your risk of theft. If you plan to use multiple locks, just make sure that one of those locks is the anchor lock that you used to register for StableCare! Remember that two locks that qualify for StableCare Gold create <strong>Alchemy</strong> and automatically make you eligible for StableCare Diamond!</p>

Plus, you will be eligible for StableCare Diamond, which will reduce your cost for theft protection by 40%!</p>

        <span>Filing a Claim</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If you fall victim to theft during the course of your Membership, you can submit a theft claim to Company to request reimbursement for your stolen vehicle.</p>
<p>The moment you discover your vehicle has been stolen, open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab. Select the StableCare Membership you wish to submit the claim under, and then tap on the “Submit Claim” button underneath your Membership card. You will be asked to provide a brief written description of the theft incident.  If you have already filed a police report (not required to file the initial claim), you may specify that you did and upload a copy of it immediately.  If not, you can simply submit the written description to create a new claim in our system.  We will not review your claim until you have uploaded a copy of the police report and have completed all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items, if any.</p>
<p>During our review, we may ask you to provide additional information or evidence.  In such an event, Company shall contact the Member via email.  Alternatively, Member can submit additional evidence for their claim to <a href="mailto:claims@stablemobility.io">claims@stablemobility.io</a> at any time during the review process, and/or by uploading image/video evidence within the Stable App under their Membership Details page. Please provide a copy of your Membership ID when sending us additional evidence via email so that we can match it against your theft claim.</p>
<p>After creating a claim, we may send you an email with additional steps or request additional information from you.</p>
<p>Before or after submitting a claim, we strongly recommend that you gather additional evidence about the theft incident to help prove your case. Other than filing a detailed police report and providing us with a copy of that police report, the additional evidence described below is not required. However, each piece of evidence will significantly improve your chances at your claim being approved. In the following sections, we outline some evidence you should consider gathering in the event that your vehicle is stolen for each scenario that is covered under your StableCare Membership.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Soon after you discover that your vehicle was stolen, you should gather evidence about the incident in support of your claim, which can substantially improve your chances at your claim being approved.  Here are some steps we recommend that you follow immediately after discovering the theft:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take photos</strong> of the &quot;crime scene,&quot; or the place where you locked up your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Look around for the defeated lock.</strong> It is likely that the thief ditched it nearby.</li>
<li>If you found the lock, <strong>take photos of the defeated lock</strong> as you found it, followed by close-ups of the lock showing how it was defeated (cut, picked, etc.).</li>
<li>If you found the lock, <strong>take it with you</strong> (all of the pieces)! It is valuable proof that you may need in the future and that we may ask you about during the claim process.</li>
<li><strong>Look around for any nearby security cameras</strong>, and take photos of them and note the building addresses and/or business names that appear to be in control of those cameras.</li>
<li><strong>File a police report</strong>, and make sure you get a copy of it. Many large cities have a way to file these reports online. If yours doesn&#x27;t, call the non-emergency number for your local police and ask them to file a report for your stolen vehicle.
<ol type="a">
<li>When filing the police report, ask the police if they can help request camera footage of the theft from any nearby cameras, especially cameras that are controlled by the city.</li>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>Enter the building that appears to be in control of the cameras and ask to speak with security personnel if there are any on site, or with the building/property manager. If the building is occupied by a business, ask to speak to the manager or owner of the business. If you are successful in getting into contact with someone who has access to the security camera footage, proceed to ask them the following questions in (b).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Can you confirm if your security cameras are pointed at the bike racks?</em> If the answer is yes:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I just had my vehicle stolen from the [area your vehicle was locked in] that has a camera pointed at it.</em> Show the email you received of your logged parking with time and location information and the theft report timecard email to prove the time window your vehicle was stolen in. Bring your copy of the police report as well, and if the police agreed to help attempt to get video footage, set up a time to bring the police with you. Then say the following:</p>
<p><em>I have theft protection with a company called Stable, and they require video evidence of the theft if it’s available. I’m also filing a police report of the theft and the camera footage will help the police create a profile of the suspect and possibly be able to identify them and try to arrest them. Are you willing to share footage from those cameras with me? The footage can be recorded through my phone on one of your monitors to make it easy for you.</em> If they are willing to provide access to the footage, this will greatly improve the speed with which your claim gets processed and the likelihood of approval.

<ol start="3">
<li>Reply to the claim email you received from us with all of the information you gathered above, including any explanations you have regarding information you were unable to gather (thief didn’t leave the lock behind, video footage was not granted, etc.). This is your chance to give us as much context as you can. Expect that we may ask additional questions, may call you to interview you, and/or may request that you provide additional information on a case-by-case basis.

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To submit a theft reimbursement claim for your vehicle in the event of a robbery, where your vehicle was physically taken from you by force or the threat of force, the following steps should be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immediate Safety Actions:</strong> Ensure you are safe, away from immediate danger, and if you are not, prioritize your safety and leave the area as quickly as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Contact the Police:</strong> As soon as it&#x27;s safe to do so, contact your local police to report the robbery. Robbery is a much more serious crime than ordinary theft, with a much more severe punishment for the criminal due to the use of force or threat of use of force. For this reason, provide the police with as much detail as possible including the description of the suspect, any vehicles the suspect used (including license plate, vehicle make, model, etc.), any descriptive characteristics of any accomplices involved, and any other relevant details that could help the police detain the criminal and recover the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a Police Report:</strong> After reporting the incident, request an official copy of the police report. This will be necessary to submit your claim. Ensure that the report includes all details you provided.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> If you still have access to your phone and the Stable App after the robbery, open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab. Select the StableCare Membership you wish to submit the claim under, and then tap on the “Submit Claim” button underneath your Membership card.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be asked to provide a brief written description of the theft incident.  If you have already filed a police report and have obtained a copy (not required to file the initial claim), you may specify that you did and upload a copy of it immediately.  If not, you can simply submit the written description to create a new claim in our system.

        <span>What to do immediately after you are robbed</span>
    </h4>
</doc-anchor-target>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Once you notice the theft, ensure that you are safe and that there are no immediate threats to you or anyone else in your dwelling. Remember that a burglar may be armed and may still be nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Contact the Police:</strong> As soon as it&#x27;s safe to do so, contact your local police and report the theft. Provide all necessary information, such as the time you last saw the vehicle, when you noticed it missing, and any other suspicious activities you may have noticed. If you have any camera evidence, review it and report any details to the police.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain a Police Report:</strong> Ensure you get an official copy of the police report after filing the incident. This is necessary for the claim submission. If you have video evidence of the theft, provide a copy to the police for use in their investigation, as it may lead to the criminal being detained and to the recovery of your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> Open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab. Select the StableCare Membership you wish to submit the claim under, and then tap on the “Submit Claim” button underneath your Membership card.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be asked to provide a brief written description of the theft incident.  If you have already filed a police report and have obtained a copy (not required to file the initial claim), you may specify that you did and upload a copy of it immediately.  If not, you can simply submit the written description to create a new claim in our system.  We will not review your claim until you have uploaded a copy of the police report and have completed all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items, if any.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If you have a security camera monitoring the area where your vehicle was locked, provide the footage as evidence.  It is highly encouraged for you to install a security camera/s in or around your dwelling to record video footage monitoring your vehicle.  Any video footage which records the incident of a burglary can be used as evidence for the police in their investigation and for your claim submission. Video evidence provides irrefutable evidence and will offer substantial weight to the approval of your claim. We will do our best to take all evidence into account when we make a decision to approve or deny your claim, and we have a primary focus to protect the Company and other Members against fraudulent claims, enabling us to bring theft protection to our Members.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>StableCare only provides theft protection for your covered vehicle at this time.  StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover any wear-and-tear, damage (including due to battery fires), defects, electrical issues, accidents, medical bills, or other kinds of liability coverage.</p>
<p>With respect to theft incidents, StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is stolen while parked and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> locked up.  StableCare also does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is lent to a friend, family member, or other third party; in other words, coverage is only provided for the specific combination of Member, covered vehicle, and anchor lock(s).</p>
<p>StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where the covered vehicle is improperly locked, such that the thief stole the vehicle without having to cut, pick, or otherwise defeat the lock with tools.  StableCare may cover theft scenarios where the thief damaged the object to which the vehicle was locked on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>StableCare does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover scenarios where theft was achieved through the disassembly of the vehicle (<em>e.g.</em>, when the lock is secured to the stem of a scooter and the thief removed the handle bars and slid the stem out of the lock).  If a thief can relatively easily disassemble parts of the vehicle to separate the vehicle from the lock, the lock-up is considered improper and therefore is not covered by StableCare, with exceptions made by the Company on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>If you are unwilling, unable, or otherwise do not file a police report with details about the theft incident to your local police, Company will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> cover your claim, absent extraordinary circumstances reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Filing a police report is essential to reducing the risk of fraud to Company, and anyone who files a false police report is committing a felony and subjecting themselves to potential fines or imprisonment.  Anyone who has had their vehicle legitimately stolen should file a police report, regardless of whether they have StableCare theft protection or not.</p>
<p>If the stolen vehicle is recovered before your claim is processed, the reimbursement might be void or adjusted based on the condition of the recovered vehicle.</p>
<p>If your claim is denied, you may appeal our decision if it is due to the suspicion of fraud. You will be required to submit evidence which supports your case against the suspicion of fraud. We commit to being thorough, transparent, expedient, and fair throughout the claims process and will do our best to consider all additional evidence provided to us. Our goal is not to deny legitimate claims of our Members, but to protect against fraudulent claims, which put the Company and our other Members at risk.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Fraud:</strong> Members are restricted access to StableCare Membership benefits if they commit fraud or are suspected of committing fraud. Members who are suspected of attempting to commit fraud will lose StableCare Membership benefits and will forfeit any Membership fees paid to Stable. Company reserves the right to press criminal charges against such Members where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Referral Fraud:</strong> Members are strictly forbidden from creating more than one Stable App user account to generate one or more referral codes using different email addresses. Creating multiple accounts to facilitate self-referrals will be deemed Referral Fraud by the Company, and will be treated as a violation of our Terms and Conditions, subject to a permanent ban from the Stable App and from losing StableCare Membership benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Use of vehicle by non-members:</strong> StableCare Membership benefits do not extend to non-members who borrow a vehicle and who log into the Stable App to log parking. StableCare Membership benefits only apply to Members and cannot be transferred in any way to non-members. Members caught sharing their Stable App log-in with non-members may have StableCare Membership benefits revoked and may be restricted from using the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit or Inappropriate Content when logging parking or mapping stables:</strong> Members are not allowed to upload explicit or inappropriate content when logging parking or mapping stables. This means no pornography, no derogatory or offensive signs, or language, or any other content that can be considered explicit. Company reserves the right to suspend or ban accounts that engage in such behavior when using the Stable App.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> The coverage amount of StableCare Membership benefits cannot be greater than the total cost of a vehicle, lock, and accessories, if you elect to add on those items. Members are required to upload proof of purchase of their vehicle and to send additional proof of purchase of any additional accessories they wish to add to coverage via email if requested by Company. Members shall upload proof of purchase of their vehicle to the StableCare Membership account page in the Stable App prior to submitting a theft claim. StableCare Membership benefits shall not exceed the total value of all items added to coverage.</p>
