# Completing your Membership

Once you've purchased a StableCare membership, you'll need to complete a few steps to **complete your membership**. You will see a notification on your Home Page while your membership is *incomplete*, prompting you to complete your membership. The outstanding action items that you need to complete will appear on your Membership details page, making it easy to complete your membership within the app.

Prior to completing your membership, Stable will not process any theft claims, so we highly encourage that you complete your membership soon after becoming a member. **Some of the steps may be difficult or impossible to complete after your vehicle gets stolen**, so we strongly recommend that you complete [those specific steps](#high-priority-action-items) right away (which are denoted in the list below by the ~ symbol). 

You will need to complete the following action items to complete your membership:

1. Agree to our [Terms and Conditions](terms-and-conditions.md)
2. Upload a proof of purchase for your vehicle
3. ~Provide the serial number of the vehicle, if you didn't do so when [registering your vehicle](../overview/account-setup.md#registering-your-vehicle)
4. ~Capture a live photo of your vehicle within the app, if you didn't do so when [registering your vehicle](../overview/account-setup.md#registering-your-vehicle)
5. ~Capture a live photo of your lock(s) within the app, if you didn't do so when [registering your lock](../overview/account-setup.md#registering-your-lock)

## High Priority Action Items


Before you can purchase a StableCare membership, you must be considered **eligible**. The concept of *eligibility* is distinct from the concept of [completing your membership]().


## After you’ve become a StableCare Member

Once you’ve paid for your StableCare Membership, you will be redirected to the app where you can view and manage your Membership, and/or use other features of the Stable App.

**Immediately after your Membership is created, your Membership will be considered “incomplete.”**  Although Members can immediately enjoy theft protection after becoming a Member, Members cannot submit a *reviewable* theft claim under their Membership until all outstanding “Membership Incomplete” action items have been completed.  While we ask that Members complete these action items in a timely manner, the Member can decide if and when they choose to complete them.  For example, if the Member wants to preserve their privacy, they can choose not to complete the Account Verification process unless and until they need to file a theft claim.

However, some of the action items may be difficult or impossible to complete after a theft incident, which if left incomplete would therefore make it effectively impossible for the Member to file a reviewable theft claim.  For instance, the serial number for your vehicle associated with your Membership must be provided prior to submitting a theft claim.  If you do not have a photo or other copy of the serial number of your vehicle, and it is stolen before you add the serial number to your Membership, then Company reserves the right to deny your claim.  Company has designed the Stable App to provide ample reminders to Members with incomplete Memberships, and encourages all Members to complete their Memberships soon after becoming a StableCare Member.

### Completing your Membership

You will need to complete the following before you can submit a reviewable theft claim.

1. You will need to review and agree to the Terms and Conditions by checking a box and providing your signature in the Agree to Terms card on the screen.
2. You will need to Upload Proof of Purchase documentation for at least the vehicle covered under your Membership.  We may also ask you to provide receipt(s) for your lock(s) and/or alarm (if you have one) by contacting you via email if Company deems it necessary to verify the coverage amount.
3. You will also need to provide your vehicle Serial Number if you have not already done so when registering your vehicle. This can be done at any time, but we recommend doing so right away, as it may be difficult or impossible to do if and after your vehicle gets stolen.
4. Upload an image of your lock(s) if you did not already do so when registering your lock.

!!!info
If your Membership is incomplete, you will see a message on your home page within the Stable App that explains that your StableCare Membership is incomplete. When you view your StableCare Membership details, you will see a list of action items that you'll need to do before you complete your Membership. While you should always refer to these Terms to ensure your compliance with our requirements, we've designed the Stable App to guide you through these post-purchase requirements.

If you start your Membership and then subsequently upgrade your lock, buy a second lock enabling **Alchemy**, buy an alarm, etc., you can reach out to us at any time to have your StableCare Membership tier upgraded and to receive a dividend on your initial payment. If any of these steps are not completed prior to submitting a theft claim for reimbursement, Stable has the right to refuse to process the claim.
