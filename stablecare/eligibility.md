# Eligibility

Before you can purchase a StableCare membership, you must be considered **eligible**. The concept of **eligibility** is distinct from the concept of [completing your membership](completing-your-membership.md), which is a guided post-purchase process that involves verifying important information that is necessary for us to review and process a theft claim.

To be **eligible** to purchase a StableCare membership, you must:

1. Be an [eligible individual](terms-and-conditions.md#eligible-members)
2. Own an [eligible vehicle](terms-and-conditions.md#eligible-vehicles)
3. Own one or more [eligible locks](terms-and-conditions.md#eligible-locks)

!!!warning 
Our mobile app is designed to automatically determine some (but not all) of the eligibility requirements. This means that it may be possible for you to create an account, register your vehicle and lock(s), [get a quote](get-a-quote.md) and purchase a StableCare membership even though you are not eligible. Notably, we do not verify whether you meet our minimum age requirement until you complete the [account verification](../overview/account-verification.md) process when [completing your membership](completing-your-membership.md), meaning that ineligible persons may be able to purchase a StableCare membership. Please ensure that you meet our eligibility requirements before you proceed with the checkout process, otherwise we may have to cancel your membership and issue you a refund.

Please refer to the eligibility section of our [Terms and Conditions](terms-and-conditions.md#eligibility) for more information.
