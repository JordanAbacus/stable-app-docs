# Get a Quote

## On our website 

You can get a mock quote for StableCare by completing the [interactive form](https://uxdhd3jgfkv.typeform.com/to/s8Z98dRR?ss_source=stabledocs) on [our website](https://www.stablemobility.io/stablecare?ss_source=stabledocs). The mock quote is viewable in the browser by clicking on the button after completing the form. A copy of the mock quote will be sent to the email you enter into the form.

## In our app

You can also get quotes in our app by navigating to the StableCare tab and either clicking on the button that says "Get a Quote," or by tapping on the "+" icon to the right of the "Quotes" label.

If you haven't registered your vehicle and at least one StableCare-eligible lock, you will be shown a form to specify a few details to get a mock quote. This mock quote will not be saved to your account. In a mock quote, you're able to check out coverage options and the respective pricing for each of them.

If you ***have*** registered your vehicle and at least one StableCare-eligible lock, you will be shown a form to select the vehicle you want coverage for, your lock(s), your alarms (if you have one), your desired coverage amount, and a discount code, if you have one. Once submitted, our system will generate a real quote, which you can view immediately and which is saved to your account. In real quotes (i.e., quotes obtained after we determined that you are eligible for StableCare), you will be shown "Buy Now" buttons that enable you to enter a checkout process to purchase your StableCare membership.
