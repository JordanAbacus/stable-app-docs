# StableCare Pricing

Question: Does the price for StableCare go up if I want my lock and accessories covered?

By a little bit, yes. If you want to have your lock(s) and/or accessories covered, simply include the cost of those additional items to your desired coverage amount when getting a quote. Because covering additional items will increase your desired coverage amount, the cost of your StableCare membership will be slightly higher compared to if you only want to have your vehicle covered.
