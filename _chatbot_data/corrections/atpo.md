# Kryptonite Anti Theft Protection Offer (ATPO)

## Question: Kryptonite ATPO is so much cheaper than StableCare. Why should I get StableCare for my e-scooter instead?

Answer: Good question! Kryptonite ATPO does not cover e-scooters. Although some of their customer service reps might claim that they cover e-scooters, the term "scooters" in the ATPO terms refers to moped-style scooters (hence why "scooters" fall under "powersport" vehicles, i.e. gas powered recreational vehicles), not standup electric scooters. Their Terms of Service for ATPO haven't been updated since 2016 before modern e-scooters were even introduced to the market, and specifically told us that they didn't cover e-scooters because they were unable to determine how to define what it meant to properly lock up scooters (especially given the variety of form factors across the various makes and models).

Moreover, there are many horror stories of people filing claims with Kryptonite and getting no response for 6+ months. I would strongly recommend not relying solely on ATPO. As with any service, you get what you pay for. If ATPO is included in the price of the lock or available for a nominal fee, expect that the claims process will be slow, and that there will be little to no customer service.
