# Real Quotes

## Question: I registered my lock in the app, but the app is still showing me the mock quote screen. Why can't I get a real quote?

Answer: If you are still seeing the mock quote screen when trying to get a quote in the app, that means that our system thinks that you haven't registered a StableCare-eligible lock to your account.

If you registered a lock that's not on our pre-approved lock list, then you won't be able to get a real quote in the app unless we manually approve your lock for StableCare. We can and do approve locks that aren't on our pre-approved lock list, so just email us at support@stablemobility.io and ask us if we'll approve your lock.

If you registered your lock and are certain that it's on our pre-approved lock list, then that means that our system wasn't able to match the lock brand and model that you registered to a pre-approved lock in our database. This is probably because the lock model name you entered doesn't exactly match the lock model name in our system. To fix this, first delete the lock you registered to your account by tapping on the card (to flip it over) and tapping on the "-" button. Then, try registering your lock again and select the lock brand and model name from the autocomplete drop-down menus. Then on the next screen, check to see that the app found a matching lock in our database and ensure that it's eligible for StableCare before clicking submit. Now you should be able to get a real quote in the app!
