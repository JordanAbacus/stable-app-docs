## Question: Do you work with insurance companies to provide theft coverage under StableCare?

Answer: Not currently, no. Stable does not work insurance companies at this time, primarily because StableCare is not insurance. StableCare is a product protection plan that covers theft, but does not provide coverage for other areas that are often covered by specialty bicycle insurance, such as liability and medical.
