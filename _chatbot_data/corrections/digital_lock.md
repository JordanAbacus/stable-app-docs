# Digital Locks vs Physical Locks

Question: Can I lock up with a digital lock, or do I need a physical lock?

Answer: App-based digital locks do not qualify as locks for StableCare. In other words, digital locks are not considered eligible locks for any StableCare Memberships. 

That being said, we consider app-based digital locks as "immobilizers," provided that the app-based lock prevents an unauthorized person from turning on and riding your vehicle. We offer an "immobilization discount" for digital locks; although you'll still need to have an eligible physical lock to purchase a StableCare membership.
