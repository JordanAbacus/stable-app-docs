# Lock Recommendations

## Question: I don't want to buy an expensive lock. What are some cheaper locks that you'd approve for StableCare?

Answer: We understand that not everyone can invest in an expensive lock, especially if you own an inexpensive e-bike or e-scooter. Here are a few locks that we'd manually approve for StableCare, even though they aren't on our pre-approved list:

* VVA U-Lock from Amazon
* Kryptonite Keeper 785 Chain Lock
* Blackburn 9" U-lock from Walmart
* Blackburn 10" U-lock from Walmart

Each of these locks listed above all have sufficient resistance to bolt cutter attacks, which is the primary reason for our approved lock list. Bolt cutters have historically been a common tool used by thieves to cut through low-quality locks discreetly without drawing too much attention to themselves.

One thing to note: when it comes to locks, you get what you pay for, generally speaking. These are budget locks that might have some annoyances (i.e., the key getting stuck, clunky lock mechanism, etc.)--but I'm sharing them with you in case you're looking for good security on a budget. In general, I recommend that people get the best lock that they can afford, but I know many people are opposed to the idea of spending more than $100 on a lock.

If you end up getting one of these locks, just let us know when you register it in the app. We'll go in and manually approve it for our Gold tier theft protection plans for you!

## Question: I'm having trouble deciding which lock to get from your list. Can you give me any recommendations?

Answer: Of course! Here are a few lock recommendations at different price points.

The Onguard Pitbull U-lock is considered great value for the money based on most reviews, and is often bundled with rental e-bike services that you might see in big cities like NYC. This lock can really only be defeated with an angle grinder, so it'll ward off most theft attacks like prying, drilling, and bolt cutters.

A solid chain lock option is the Kryptonite Evolution 1090, which uses 10mm hardened manganese steel chain links. Chains are heavier than comparable U-locks within the same security class, but offer a bit more flexibility with what you can lock to. Moreover, chain locks with big enough links (like this one) tend to be more difficult to cut with angle grinders, since the chain flails and is harder to hold steady to get one solid cut through them.

Probably the best "gold-tier" U-lock is the Kryptonite Fahgettaboutit, which has a beefy 18mm shackle. Larger shackles are visually intimidating, and take longer to cut through than much thinner shackles like the Master Lock U-lock.

A contender for the "ideal" lock in my opinion is the angle grinder-resistant Litelok X1. This UK-based company uses a proprietary alloy that is designed to specifically resist angle grinder attacks. If you're thinking about investing enough to get a high end Kryptonite Lock, I would just upgrade to the X1. Tests show it takes something like 4 angle grinder discs to cut all the way through just one side of the shackle. So it can still be cut, but it would probably take a thief 5-10 minutes to cut through it, which substantially reduces your risk of theft.

The Litelok X3 and the Hiplok D1000 are probably tied as the best locks on the market. Both are in the $300 range, and both boast being able to resist at least 8 angle grinder discs. It would take a very determined thief to cut through either of them.

## Question: I've seen many pictures of cut Kryptonite locks. Are they any good?

Answer: I would say that they are in the "very good" tier based on testing performed by Sold Secure and ART (two of the main ratings agencies for lock security). The sad reality is that every lock on the market can be cut through by an angle grinder with enough time and effort. Even the best Kryptonite locks can be cut through in maybe 10 seconds with a decent angle grinder. This would be true for other major brands like ABUS.

The only locks that are stepping up their security game are the Litelok X1, Litelok X3, and Hiplok D1000. They use specialized materials that are designed to heat up and ablate angle grinder discs, making them highly resistant to angle grinder attacks. Most tests of the Litelok X1 show that it takes at least 4 angle grinder discs to cut through it, with maybe 5 minutes of continuous effort. The X3 and the D1000 offer about twice that security. These locks are in a league of their own, though.

I consider the Sold Secure "gold" tier locks as all being resistant to bolt cutters, but angle grinder attacks can easily defeat many $100+ locks. With enough searching, you'll find the remnants of most lock brands strewn about on sidewalks or still linked to bike racks.

## Question: Would you approve the Skunklock for StableCare?

Answer: We've decided that we'll approve the Skunklock for our Diamond tier plans. It's in our database, so if you register your lock in the app after I update our database, it should automatically be approved for StableCare Gold and Diamond tier plans.

However, if you don't already own the Skunklock, I would personally consider getting a different lock. I saw a review that said that the lock began to leak over time and smelled up their apartment. Not sure if that's common or was just a rare thing (not a lot of info from their customers).

If you haven't yet bought it, I would strongly consider getting the Litelok X1 instead. It's basically the same price as the Skunklock, but uses angle grinder resistant material that they dub "Barronium." The X1 is a big step up in security over even the top U-locks like the Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit, and I think is the sweet spot for price vs. security for most e-bikes and e-scooters.

But if you already have the Skunklock, or like the idea of fighting back against thieves with noxious chemical smells, then we fully support it!
