# StableCare Tier Differences

## Question: What's the difference between StableCare Gold and StableCare Diamond?

Answer: Our two main theft protection plans are called StableCare Gold and StableCare Diamond. Both provide the same coverage against theft, but have different lock requirements and different pricing.

Our Gold tier plans are so named because they require a lock that meets the Sold Secure Gold (Pedal) standard or better. Sold Secure Gold-rated locks are generally considered resistant to most vectors of attack (hammering, raking, bolt cutters, etc.) except for powered angle grinders. Many locks in this category can be cut in 10-15 seconds with a battery-powered angle grinder.

Somewhat confusingly, Sold Secure recently updated their ratings to have separate classifications for acoustic bicycles (the "Pedal" standard) and for powered vehicles (the "Powered" standard). From our analysis, Sold Secure Gold (Pedal), Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal), and Sold Secure Gold (Powered) all offer similar levels of security, and so we consider locks in this category as "Gold-tier" locks.

The highest security locks fall into the Sold Secure Diamond (Powered) rating, which include locks that are angle grinder resistant. The notable locks in this category are the Litelok X1, Litelok X3, and the Hiplok D1000, all of which are capable of destroying angle grinder blades and can withstand 5-10 minutes of continuous cutting. Because the risk of theft is much lower for these top tier locks, we offer plans at a substantial discount which we call the "Diamond" tier plans.

The reason we only approve locks with good security is to keep our pricing down. The rate of theft for vehicles locked with cheap cable locks is something like ~5x higher than for vehicles locked with a solid U-lock. If we allowed bad locks that can be easily cut, we'd have to raise prices to account for the higher rates of theft.

We have documentation that you can check out if you want to dig in a bit more. And if there's anything missing from the docs, you can always reach out at hello@stablemobility.io--we'd be happy to clarify anything that's confusing!
