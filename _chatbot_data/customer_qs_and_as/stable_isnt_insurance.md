# About StableCare Not Being Insurance

## Question: Is Stable an insurance company?

We are not an insurance company (yet). We offer e-scooter product protection plans, which specifically cover theft, but we are not technically a licensed insurance provider. As we have not done extensive legal research on the regulatory requirements for offering product protection plans in your country, we would probably want to do that first and get back to you. These types of protection plans and insurance policies are often highly regulated, so we'd like to make sure that we are able to sell such a policy to you in your country.

## Question: What is StableCare theft protection, if it's not insurance?

Since StableCare theft protection plans operate like extended warranties, there are fewer legal requirements for us. But, in the interest of being transparent, since it's not technically "insurance," we do not have the same financial requirements as traditional insurance companies.

## Question: What requirements do insurance companies have to follow that Stable doesn't?

These requirements are typically the purchase of government bonds (called surety bonds) that provide government-backed financial guarantees to policyholders to ensure that they can still submit claims and get reimbursed, even if we were to go belly-up. Since we're not (yet) a licensed insurance provider, we don't have these financial guarantees--although we are voluntarily working with a surety bond agency to purchase a bond to cover all of our liabilities. All that being said, building up trust with riders like you is our #1 priority, and ensuring we have the capital to pay out claims is of critical importance to us--as one or two bad reddit posts could kill us at this stage, so we have taken the steps to ensure that we can make good on our promises.
