# Payment Terms and Options

## Question: Can I pay for StableCare monthly, instead of annually or seasonally?

Yes! In case you didn't know, it's possible to pay for StableCare monthly using Affirm or Klarna; but we know these micro-loans come with interest and are definitely less than ideal. We're open to offering customers a special discount code to essentially pay for the interest with these services (we just did so with another customer recently!), so you'd basically get to pay monthly at no extra cost compared to paying annually. 

Apart from those options, we're open to setting up monthly payments for individual customers if they need that for financial reasons. Right now, monthly subscriptions are not an option in our app, and needs to be set up manually on our end. Just reach out to us at support@stablemobility.io to ask for a monthly subscription.

## Question: Why aren't monthly payment options available without special permission and approval?

The main reason that we don't offer monthly subscriptions without special approval is to mitigate fraud. Offering monthly payments incentivizes fraud claims-that is, someone buys StableCare for 1 month (say for like $10-20), stages the theft, and then earns a windfall of thousands of dollars. Traditional insurance companies often handle this risk by doing some combination of (1) requiring a minimum amount of monthly payments to be made before you can file a claim (e.g., $100 must be paid in before you can file a claim) and/or (2) the use of deductibles in their various forms. 

Personally, we don't like the idea of forcing our customers to sign contracts or having fine print that people might not read before buying coverage, only to later discover that they can't file a claim for some technicality. So we ask for an upfront payment for the whole season or year, unless you are financially constrained and can't use Affirm or Klarna for whatever reason.
