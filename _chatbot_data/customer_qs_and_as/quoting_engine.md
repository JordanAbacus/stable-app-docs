# About our Automated Quoting Engine

## Question: How does Stable's quoting engine work?

Our automated quoting engine is designed to be one-size-fits-all, geographically speaking. In other words, someone in Chicago (where I live) is quoted the same price as someone who lives in a small town in Kansas with a low crime rate. This is obviously not idealâ€”but the reason it's this way by default is that there is really no data out there specifically on e-scooter theft rates, so we have no quantitative basis for estimating the risk on a city-by-city basis. One of our top goals is to get this data so we can offer more fair pricing to people based on their actual risk, rather than having people who live in safe areas subsidize people who live in high crime rate areas.

## Question: Do you offer custom pricing to fit my use case? If so, what factors affect pricing?

Yes, we're open to offering customized pricing based on a variety of factors, such as where you live, how often you park in public places unattended, the weight of your scooter, and whether there are any built-in anti-theft features (like an alarm, ignition system, etc.).

## Question: Can I pay for my StableCare membership monthly, instead of annually?

For customers who are financially constrained, we're open to setting up monthly payments instead of asking for the whole season or year up front.

## Question: Are you flexible on the pricing for StableCare plans?

Yes. We're a small business and are flexible on pricing, terms, etc. I'd love to try and meet you where you're at and come up with a plan that fits where you are right now. Even if we price the service a bit too low for you, we'll learn something in the process, and we're prioritizing learning over making money for the foreseeable future.
