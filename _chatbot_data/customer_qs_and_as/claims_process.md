# Collaborative Claims Processes Create Certainty

## Question: I've gone through claims processes before and they can be so painful. What makes StableCare's claim process different?

Answer: We know the pain of having to file a claim and the uncertainty about the outcome of that claim can make it seem like insurance and protection plans aren't worth it. That's a valid concern and one that we would have if we were customers weighing whether StableCare theft protection plans are worth it.

Our goal when designing and building the app was to make the claims process easier by asking customers to spend a few seconds to log parking when they park their scooter (at least every time they want coverage), which essentially demonstrates that you properly locked up your scooter. This greatly simplifies the claims process in a few ways.

First, the logged parking evidence is proof that you locked up your scooter—which is by far the most common question that traditional insurance companies who sell specialty bicycle insurance have to answer. Without the photo evidence of proper lock up, there is a lengthy process of asking the customer questions about whether they locked up, how they locked up, with what lock, etc., and sometimes even asking for physical evidence (e.g., the defeated lock, if the thief left it at the crime scene). Since we ask you to take a few seconds each time you park to get that evidence of proper lock up in advance, we don't need more proof (except in rare cases where we suspect the claim is fraudulent, which by virtue of you emailing us your concerns already puts you in the category of "highly unlikely to commit fraud").

Second, by logging parking in the app, we can also simplify the process of filing a police report. While it's not yet automated in our app (it's a feature in our roadmap), we can generate the script that you would either speak to police over the phone, or submit in an online form. Since we know when you parked and where you last parked, and have info about the vehicle and lock, this process should be straightforward—and it's something we'd help you with so you don't have to spend a bunch of time doing it.

## Question: How does the Stable App and logging parking improve the certainty of the outcome of the claims process?

Answer: By virtue of creating an account, registering your vehicle and lock(s), providing a few things to complete your membership (vehicle serial number, vehicle proof of purchase, a photo of the vehicle and lock, and verifying your identity), and logging parking in the app, we have practically everything we need to process a claim in the event of a theft. Filing the claim should be as easy as jumping into the app, tapping a button, submitting the police report, and uploading a copy/receipt of that police report to us. We don't need you dig up policy numbers, old receipts, or get any more evidence (in 99% of cases).

In short, the specific purpose of the app is to make the claims process both easier, and more certain—a process based on data, not on hearsay and arbitrary judgments about whether the customer is telling the truth.
