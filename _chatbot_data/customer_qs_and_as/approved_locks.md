# Lock Requirement Explanations and Justifications

## Question: What is the approved lock list based on?

Answer: We based our approved lock list on the Sold Secure lock security standard. There are many locks on the market that haven't been rated by Sold Secure, but it doesn't mean that they aren't great locks. Our criteria is really whether the lock can be cut with hand tools (e.g., bolt cutters). Almost every lock on the market can be easily cut with a powered angle grinder, but many locks can't be cut with bolt cutters, including your folding lock (based on our research).

## Question: All of the locks on your list are so expensive. Why don't you allow cheaper locks?

Answer: The reason for the approved set of locks is because there are many inexpensive locks that can be easily cut with cheap tools, like bolt cutters. If we allowed any type of lock, we'd have to increase our prices to offset the increased risk, so we're trying to find a happy medium of a decent lock and a decent price.

That being said, there are inexpensive locks that resist bolt cutter attacks that we'll approve for StableCare. If you need recommendations, just ask me or reach out at hello@stablemobility.io and ask Stable for recommendations!

## Question: Do I really have to buy a gold-tier lock? It seems arbitrary.

Answer: Yes, we do require a Gold-level lock for most customers. But we are also open to approving locks on a case-by-case basis. Our lock list is based largely off the Sold Secure standard, with the approved locks all being resistant to bolt cutter attacks (which are quite common). If you can share your lock with us, we can do some research on it and will get back to you in a day or so to let you know if we'd approve of it or not.

And we agree that the lock list if somewhat arbitrary. There are so many locks on the market that are very good, but have not been tested and rated by Sold Secure. This is why we approve locks that aren't on our list all of the time for customers! Just tell us what lock you have at support@stablemobility.io and ask for approval.
