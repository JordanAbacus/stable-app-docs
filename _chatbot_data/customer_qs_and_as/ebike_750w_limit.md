# Why Insurance for E-Bikes With Motors Above 750W Doesn't Exist

## Question: Why did you start your company, Stable?

We specifically built this company to provide coverage to the underserved PEV market, the largest categories being e-scooters and e-bikes with power above 750W.

## Question: How are you able to cover e-bikes with motors above 750W?

The reason we can do this (while the others technically can't) is because we're not underwritten by Markel—the largest specialty bike insurance carrier that underwrites the policies for almost all of the brokers (Velosurance, Simple Bike Insurance, etc.)—and as the carrier Markel decides what the policy is. The brokers can only sell it and explain it, but they can't modify the policy. I presume that Markel capped coverage for e-bikes at 750W because anything above that means that they are both (1) unregulated, i.e. they fall outside of the Class 1, 2, and 3 designations, and (2) because higher power means faster speed, which increases the risks for personal injury/liability, which they also provide coverage for.

As for us, we're doing our own underwriting and risk modeling, so we have total flexibility with what we can and can't cover. But for the sake of transparency, that also makes us a riskier company to get coverage from, since we don't yet have the same financial guarantees that a large insurance carrier offers. Our goal is to prove demand in the market for insurance for e-scooters, performance e-bikes, and other PEVs, and then to work with insurance carriers and/or reinsurance providers to back the policies. In the interim, we're voluntarily securing surety bonds to financially back all of our obligations, in addition to ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity to pay out claims at well above the rate we anticipate.

## Question: Sundays Insurance agents are saying that they'll cover e-bikes with motors above 750W, but their website says that 750W is the maximum power that they'll cover. Why is this?

Sundays is a different story. They started as a broker for Markel, but relatively recently switched carriers to USSIC/Tokio Marine Holdings, which is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi that provides a variety of speciality insurance products. I believe the reason they made this switch is because they wanted to undercut Markel by requiring better locks, and in turn lower premiums because of the reduced risk of theft.

Because Sundays is the only major insurance provider in the US that is underwritten by someone other than Markel, I don't fully know what their agreement is with their carrier USSIC. Sometimes, insurance providers can build relationships with insurance carriers whereby they are given authority to do their own actuarial science and underwriting, which is referred to as a Managing General Agent (MGA). MGAs typically can make adjustments to the policy, such as offering coverage for higher powered e-bikes.

All that being said, I'm not 100% sure that Sundays is in fact an MGA, or if their agents are just playing "fast and loose" with the terms. I have reason to believe that Sundays is in fact playing fast and loose with the terms because they have told customers that they'll cover your higher powered e-bike as long as it is configured to be in the lower powered mode. For instance, they've told Onyx riders I talk to that they'll cover the Onyx RCR for theft, as long as it was in the street legal Class 3 750W mode. How would they know if you did that? Beats me! But this suggests to me that they are technically only allowed to cover e-bikes with power at or below 750W, and are coming up with creative ways to take market share from Markel.

## Question: What questions should I ask Sundays Insurance to determine whether or not they'll cover e-bikes with motors above 750W?

Ask them about their status as a provider—i.e., are they a broker, or MGA for USSIC/Tokio Marine? How can they offer coverage for higher powered e-bikes when others can't?
