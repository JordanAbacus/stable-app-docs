# Coverage For Events Other Than Theft

## Question: Does StableCare provide coverage for anything other than theft, such as medical or liability?

Answer: No. Currently, we only offer theft coverage--not liability, medical, or repairs. If you want coverage for repairs or parts, you should check out Extend or Mulberry (two common companies that I often see that sell extended warranties to cover accidental damage and repairs).

I'll mention though that we cover a handful of theft scenarios, which are specified in our Terms and Conditions. These include (1) theft when parked away from home, (2) theft that occurs at or near home, and (3) theft that occurs while you're riding (i.e., if you get shoved off your scooter, robbed when stopped at a red light, etc.).

We may add other coverage in the future. If you want to be notified of new coverage categories in the future, either get a mock quote on our website or just email us at hello@stablemobility.io to be added to our email list. We promise never to spam you or sell your data!
