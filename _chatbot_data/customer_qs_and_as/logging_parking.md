# Logging Parking Explanation and Justification 

## Question: Do I really have to log parking? Would you make an exception for me?

Answer: We are open to waiving the requirement to log parking. The only caveat there is that, in the event of a theft, we will still ask you to furnish some evidence to prove that your Apollo was locked up before it got stolen (e.g., picture of a cut lock and/or security footage of the theft)â€”just like any other insurance company would for policies that have a lock-up requirement.

The goal with asking customers to take 5-10 seconds to snap the photo before the incident is to make the claims process more certain. In fact, before we launched StableCare, we designed the app as sort of an independent "insurance buddy" to make it easier for people to gather evidence for theft insurance claims (for policies from other companies).

## Question: I'm interested in StableCare, but logging parking sounds like a lot of work and I don't want to do it. Do I have to log parking?

Answer: We understand why the concept of logging parking would make you hesitant. We ask that customers take a few seconds to do this when they lock up and want coverage because it proves that you locked up your scooter prior to a theft incident. All existing speciality bicycle insurance companies have a similar lock-up requirement, but do not have an app for gathering this evidence. As a result, when a theft occurs, the burden is on the customer to gather evidence to prove that they complied with the terms of their agreement (i.e., take a photo of the broken/cut lock, send the broken lock to the insurance company, get security footage of the theft from a nearby camera, etc.).

The purpose of logging parking is to ask the customer to take a few seconds to get this evidence before the theft occurs, so that if your e-bike gets stolen, then we know it was locked up before the incident. The goal is create more certainty for you, not headaches or inconvenience.

All that being said, we're willing to waive the requirement to use the app to log parking, so long as you're aware that we'll ask you to procure evidence that you properly locked up the scooter prior to the incident and demonstrate that the lock was defeated by the thief (at a minimum, a description of what you locked to, and some kind of evidence that it was locked up). In our opinion, the tradeoff of taking 5-10 seconds to log parking is worth the increased certainty as to the outcome of your claim, but we know that not everyone sees it this way!

One more point to clarify: you don't have to log parking every time you park your e-bike. We have a few customers who decided they only want to do that if they park in unsafe areas, or are otherwise more worried about theft on certain occasions. If you're confident when you park somewhere that the risk of theft is extremely low, then it's up to you if you want to log parking. We won't penalize you for not logging parking or anything--it just means that you won't have that piece of evidence if it happens to get stolen that time.

## Question: Can I get coverage for my kids' e-scooters?

Yes, we can absolutely cover your kids' scooters!

However, I want to emphasize that we typically require our customers to use our mobile app to snap a photo of their locked up scooter or e-bike (what we call "logging parking"). This is an important step because it proves to us that the customer locked up the vehicle prior to it being stolen. Check out our documentation on how StableCare theft protection works for a bit more info.

Lock-up requirements are a common practice. All specialty bicycle insurance companies require that the vehicle is locked up, and all require the customer to prove that they locked up the vehicle and that the lock was defeated by the thief in order to steal the vehicle. Unsurprisingly, the risk of theft is roughly 3-4x more likely if the vehicle isn't locked up, which makes it cost-prohibitive to offer theft coverage without a lock-up requirement.

Logging parking in our app is the way in which we remove a significant source of uncertainty in the claims process for our customers.

Given the above, we have a couple of questions for you:

1. Do your kids typically lock up their scooters when go places and park it unattended?
2. Do you think your kids would be willing to use our app to log parking (prove that they locked up their scooter) per our requirements?

I think we could extend theft coverage to your kids without requiring logging parking in our app. But we would still require that the vehicle be locked up and, if it were stolen, we would ask you to furnish some evidence to prove that it was locked up and that the lock was defeated (e.g., a photo of the cut lock, security camera footage of the thief stealing the vehicle, etc.). As with traditional, speciality bike insurance companies, this process would be much more uncertain, but we're open to doing it as we realize that asking teenage kids to remember to comply with our requirements might be a tall order.

I'm saying all of this because I want to make sure you and your family actually derive value from our service (even at the risk of losing you as a customer). That being said, we are flexible and can adapt the policy, requirements, and pricing to fit with your use case.

## Question: I want theft coverage, but not so badly that I would log parking. Can you change my mind?

For what it's worth, I want to mention one small detail (which probably won't change your mind). You technically don't have to take the photo when you lock up every time, but only when you want coverage, if that makes sense. So if you forget or just don't feel like doing it, it's not like it would void your membership or that we would deny a claim because you forgot to take the pic in the past. If you only take the pic when you are actually worried about theft (like if you're parking in a risky area or leaving it unattended for a while), then that's fine.

We might even consider approving a claim if someone just happened to forget to log parking the one time their scooter gets stolen; but it is the core piece of evidence that shows that you did lock up. However, say a thief cut through your lock(s) and left them on the ground, or there was a nearby security camera and you managed to get the footage of the theft (i.e., there's leftover evidence of the crime), we would likely approve your claim even without the photo of your locked-up scooter.

We're really just trying to deter/weed out fraudulent claims. By virtue of you asking this question, you probably fall into the category of "highly unlikely to commit fraud" (i.e., a scammer probably wouldn't go through the trouble of even asking the question!).
