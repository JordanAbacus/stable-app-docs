# StableCare Simplified

## Question: What is StableCare?

Answer: StableCare theft protection plans reimburse you for the loss of your micromobility vehicle if it gets stolen. However, we'll only do that if you locked up your vehicle before it was stolen with an approved lock. We ask customers to use our app to take a few seconds to snap a photo of their locked up vehicle to prove that it was locked up in case it gets stolen during that parking instance.

If your vehicle gets stolen, all you need to do is tap a button in the app to notify us, file a police report (we can help you with that), and then upload a copy of that police report in our app. As long as it was properly locked up (i.e., the thief had to cut your lock or disassemble your vehicle to free it from the lock), we'll approve your claim.

It's pretty much that simple! We built the app to make it easy for customers to register their vehicle and lock(s), which automatically tries to determine if you are eligible for StableCare based on whether the lock you register is on our pre-approved list. We can also manually approve locks that aren't on our list, depending on the level of security they provide.
