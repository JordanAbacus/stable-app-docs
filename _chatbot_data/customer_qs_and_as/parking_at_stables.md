# About Parking At Stables

## Question: If I don't need to park at Stables to get StableCare theft protection, why are Stables in the app?

Answer: You do not need to park at a Stable to get coverage. We initially designed the Stable App to be something like an "insurance buddy" for acoustic bicycle and e-bike riders to help them find camera-monitored parking spots, specifically to help them get evidence for theft insurance claims. While we still recommend in our documentation that riders park at Stables, it is absolutely not a requirement in any way to enjoy theft protection under your StableCare membership. Stables are user-submitted, and are not in many cities as we shifted our focus toward offering our own theft protection plans for e-scooter riders.

We encourage parking in areas that are monitored by nearby security cameras because it increases the chance at getting video footage of a thief cutting/picking your lock and stealing your e-bike.

However, we would only ask for that kind of video footage evidence if the circumstances around the theft are suspicious. For instance, say a customer purchases a StableCare membership, doesn't take the few seconds to take a photo of their locked up e-bike in the app, and then they report it stolen within a few days of becoming a member. We would flag that case as having a higher likelihood of a fraudulent claim, and may ask for additional proof of the theft (like the video footage).

For the vast majority of cases, we won't ask for such evidence, as we expect the vast majority of people (like you!) are honest and trustworthy. That said, we specify in our Terms and Conditions that we have the right to request that information if we believe it to be important to rule out the possibility of fraud.


## Question: Logging parking sounds pretty annoying and cumbersome. Do I really have to do it?

Answer: If I can clarify a couple things: (1) you don't have to find a specific place to lock it up (i.e., you don't have to park at Stables), and (2) you don't have to log parking every time you park, only when you want coverage (if that makes sense). Logging parking in the app really only takes a few seconds. I do it regularly, and we have customers who do it regularly, and so far we've had no feedback that it is too difficult or time consuming. So if you ride and park somewhere that seems safe to you, you don't have to log parking (and hope it just doesn't get stolen that time, of course).

I can definitely see your perspective, though. The joy of riding is not having to do any extra steps other than turn it on and go. StableCare is really designed so people can experience the joy of riding, and at their destination can park without having to worry -- in other words, not having to sit near the window to monitor their scooter, check on it, or have it consume any amount of mental energy while they're doing other things. For me, the freedom of riding is diminished when I have to debate whether or not to ride my scooter when it could be stolen while I'm away from it.


## Question: If I can't get video footage of a theft, will you deny my claim?

Answer: As a younger company, the last thing we want to do is arbitrarily deny our customers' claims (unless fraud is blatantly apparent) because we want to grow our business and make our customers as happy as possible. Denying a claim to save a bit money on small technicalities would be a losing strategy for us in the long term. Both of the co-founders of Stable (me and Bjondi) have invested a lot of our own money and substantial time in making this company and launching StableCareâ€”so rest assured that denying a claim because someone didn't park at a Stable would undermine our long term goals!
