# About Kryptonite's Anti-Theft Protection Offer (ATPO)

## Question: Does Kryptonite's APTO cover e-scooters? It seems like a cheap alternative to StableCare.

Answer: This will sound like it benefits us, but I would exercise a lot of caution and would not recommend relying on Kryptonite ATPO. We worked closely with the Kryptonite team (their PR manager who left the company last week, their head of customer service who handles their claims, and others) earlier this year in an attempt to collaborate with them -- basically, to pair our app with their ATPO service for e-scooters specifically. They sat on it for 2 months, and finally got back to us and said that they were not ready to expand ATPO to cover e-scooters.

Their customer service reps might claim that they cover e-scooters, but they mean moped-style scooters (hence why "scooters" fall under "powersport" vehicles, i.e. gas powered recreational vehicles), not standup electric scooters. Their Terms of Service for ATPO haven't been updated since 2016 before modern e-scooters were even introduced to the market, and specifically told us that they didn't cover e-scooters because they were unable to determine how to define what it meant to properly lock up scooters (especially given the variety of form factors across the various makes and models).

Moreover, there are many horror stories of people filing claims with Kryptonite and getting no response for 6+ months. I would strongly recommend not relying solely on ATPO.

That being said, if you do end up getting a Kryptonite lock, it doesn't hurt to register for ATPO (especially for higher end locks, which I think gives you 1 year of ATPO for free) and trying to file a claim if the lock gets cut and your scooter is stolen (on top of other insurance/coverage you might get). Just don't tell them about the other policy ;)

## Question: I read Kryptonite's ATPO Terms, and it says that it covers "scooters." Doesn't that include e-scooters?

Answer: No! We were convinced that it covered e-scooters, which is why we thought it made a ton of sense to improve the ATPO program by making it fairly easy for customers to get the evidence they need to submit claims. We made a presentation for them, proposed a path to partner together, talked about using our app to distribute educational content about lock attacks and proper lock up. And it culminated in the Head of Customer Service telling us they weren't ready to expand ATPO to cover e-scooters.

Still, there are people who have told us they talked to Kryptonite and specifically said that they'll cover electric scooters. At which point I tell them that they should ask the customer service rep to name 3 examples of "e-scooters" (make & model), and write out a definition for what is and isn't an e-scooter, and then finally ask why e-scooters fall under "powersport" vehicles while e-bikes don't (even though they are "powered")? Kryptonite doesn't know, and their customer service reps just read "scooter" and say "yep we cover scooters!!!"

All that being said, they might pay out an e-scooter person for a claim. But yeah it's my understanding that the vast majority of the time they ask you to ship them the pieces of the cut lock, and refuse to pay out unless you can do that.

The way we see it, if the thief cuts the things that your vehicle is locked to with an angle grinder, that should be covered. If they can pick up both the scooter and the thing it's locked to and load it into a van or something, then you probably didn't lock it to something big/heavy enough. But even that's a gray area.
