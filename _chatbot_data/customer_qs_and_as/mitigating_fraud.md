# Mitigating Fraud

## Question: Why do you prefer not to pay out claims in cash? Don't you have other ways of mitigating fraud?

Answer: We have ways to mitigate fraud, including requiring customers to scan an ID in the app, take a selfie, and phone verify before they can submit a claim. And while we don't always track user activity in the app, we do track how many times they park their scooter and store the photo. There are a lot of steps there and we believe most fraudsters won't waste their time. But you are 100% right that replacing the scooter instead of paying out cash is a major deterrent to fraud, which is why we've structured our Terms to say that we will purchase replacement items for you unless doing so is impractical or impossible, or if you specifically need a cash reimbursement.
