# Manual Lock Approvals

## Question: I have a lock that's not on the pre-approved list. How does the manual approval process work?

The manual lock approval process is simple! Just register your lock(s) in the app to your account, and then send us a note at support@stablemobility.io to ask for approval. We'll let you know within 24 hours whether we approve any of your locks, and will update your account accordingly. Once your account has been updated, you'll be able to get a real quote for StableCare in the app.
