## Automatic Bug Detection

We baked into the app a way to automatically detect when the app crashes or bugs out; so we will work to _stabilize_ the app over time, regardless of whether you submit those bugs or not.

For other bugs such as unexpected behaviors (_i.e._, which do not crash the app), your bug reports are very useful to help us get the app working as intended. Thank you!
