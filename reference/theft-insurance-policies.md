## United States

### Markel

In the United States, [Markel Insurance](https://www.markelinsurance.com/bicycle) is an insurance carrier that underwrites speciality bicycle insurance policies, which includes theft coverage at and away from home. They cover both traditional bicycles and e-bikes with motors that are at or below 750W and travel no faster than 28 mph. See their FAQ for more details.

Markel has a publicly-available [sample theft insurance policy](https://mkl-sitecore102-prod-326360-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/~/media/specialty/2018-web/bicycle/specimen-cyclist-policy.pdf?rev=a0a27650d8f94d849adbafca5ba08210&hash=7D790D04E5BFC3B35259CB22B407A779). Here are a few notable details within this policy as it relates to theft coverage:

- when parking your bike or e-bike away from home, the policy will only pay out if the bike is "properly secured to an **immovable object** with an **appropriate security locking device**
- an "appropriate security locking device" is defined as "a device with a key lock or combination lock designed to physically and securely fasten a bicycle to a bicycle stand or an immovable object"
- an "immovable object" is defined as one of the following:
  - "any solid object fixed in or onto concrete or stone, which is not capable of being undone, removed or lifted under/over the insured bicycle"
  - "a properly fixed motor vehicle roof rack"
  - "a properly fixed vehicle bicycle rack"
- the policy will only pay out if you can provide "a copy of a police report detailing the time, place and manner of the theft and the security device that was used"
- if you lend your bike to someone and they steal it from you, that is not covered

!!!
Notably, Markel's policy does not specify an allowed list of locks; any lock meeting the "appropriate security locking device" description can be used.

Markel states that providing all relevant information when making a claim will both speed up the process, and improve your chances at being reimbursed for the loss of your vehicle. The relevant information includes:

- Your policy number
- The date, time, and location of the theft
- Photo(s) of where the bicycle was stolen, including that of the damaged lock(s) (if they are left by the thief)
- A copy of a police report
- Receipts for your bicycle (and lock(s)/accessories/spare parts/etc. if you elected coverage for them)

Markel underwites the policies for a handful of brokers in the United States, including [Velosurance](https://velosurance.com), [Simple Bike Insurance](https://simplebikeinsurance.com), and others. This means that policies sold through these brokers will most likely be subject to the same requirements as those listed above for Markel.

#### Velosurance

Velosurance describes the [process of filing](https://velosurance.com/claims/) a theft claim as follows:

- A police report detailing how the theft occurred; submit your claim ASAP, even if a police report is not immediately available
- A picture of the defeated security device/lock, if available
- Your statement of how the bike was secured
- A receipt or photo of the security device, if available 
- Your policy number

They also state that you "may be asked to provide pre-accident photos and bike purchase receipts."

#### Simple Bike Insurance

Simple Bike Insurance (SBI) provides a [guide for filing a claim](https://simplebikeinsurance.com/claims/), which lists the following details needed for theft claims:

- **A copy of your police report**. SBI says that you *can* initiate a claim without it, but indicates that it will likely be needed to finish processing the claim.
- **Detailed photos of any evidence of theft**, if you have them. This includes photos of the damaged lock.
- **A description of what happened and how it happened**, including dates, times, other individuals involved, locations, etc.
- **Copies of receipts for your lock(s)**
- **Your policy number**
