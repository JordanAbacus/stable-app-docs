A Stable is a parking spot that is within view of a security camera. Conversely, a Post(short for \"Hitching Post\") is a parking spot that is _ not_ within view of a security camera.","We are aware that, just because there is a security camera nearby, doesn't necessarily mean that it's operational, pointed at the parking spot, and that the owner is willing to share the footage. We are actively developing the process of verifying these details.","The reason we differentiate camera-monitored spots is simple: if your vehicle gets stolen, you ideally want to get video footage of the theft occurring— especially if you have theft insurance or another theft reimbursement coverage.","Video footage is the best proof you can get that you properly locked up your vehicle to an immovable object, and that the lock itself was defeated (picked/cut/etc.) by a thief—which are the most common requirements to filing a theft insurance or reimbursement claim."]},{"l":"Gathering Evidence","p":["In addition to helping riders find camera-monitored parking spots (Stables), the app also provides a painless way to Log Parking, which can be useful to prove that your vehicle was properly locked up prior to a theft occurring.","To log parking, the rider can open the Log Parking page and quickly snap a photo of your locked-up vehicle before walking away from it.

For internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, we burn excess fossil fuels to move a 4,000 lb car usually carrying only 1 person who weighs less than 5% the weight of their car.","And while EVs effectively emit less carbon than ICE cars, much of the energy from the grid used to charge them is derived from burning fossil fuels. Moreover, EVs inherit the same issue of their ICE counterparts—they are needlessly large and heavy, and thus consume power far in excess of what is needed to move their passenger.","Micromobility offers many benefits over automobility:","Faster trips: The average driving speed in most cities is under 15 mph. Most PEVs average more than this.","Reduced congestion: getting cars off the road reduces traffic (obviously!)","Less energy consumed: most PEVs fit the size of the rider and weigh well under 100 lbs.","Cleaner air: no tailpipe emissions!","Lower CO2 emissions: reduces the single biggest contributor to CO2 emissions: transportation","Environmental immersion: You experience the surrounding environment in a more connected way than in a car.","More fun: Riding through a city is just more fun on a micromobility vehicle!"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Signing up for an account in the Stable App"]},{"l":"Account Registration","p":["To create your account, first download the Stable App for iOS (open beta on TestFlight) or Android (open beta on Google Play Store).","You should now see the splash screen.","Click on the Register button to create a new account.

Company may also review logged parking photos taken by Members at random to verify that Members are consistently performing proper lock-up. If Company determines that a Member is not locking up properly, Company will contact the Member with additional details.","Ineligible vehicles are disqualified from StableCare Membership benefits. Any money paid or deposits made shall be refunded to you.

Members may choose to lock up with additional locks other than their anchor lock, with no effect on their theft protection coverage under their StableCare Membership. However, if a Member only lock up with such additional locks and not with their anchor lock, their StableCare Membership will not provide theft protection for the Member’s vehicle. For StableCare Memberships that specify two locks ( i.e., to receive the Alchemy discount), both locks are considered the “anchor” lock, meaning that both locks must be used any time the Member wishes to enjoy theft protection under their Membership.","To be eligible for StableCare Gold, you must own and register an anchor lock that meets a minimum standard of Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Gold, Sold Secure Pedal Cycle Diamond, or Sold Secure Power Cycle Gold lock.

For this reason, please check the autocomplete lock brands and model names when registering your lock. Our database should contain every lock classified as Sold Secure Gold (Pedal), Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal), Sold Secure Gold (Powered), and Sold Secure Diamond (Powered). If you register a lock that is not found in our database, but you believe it to be classified as one of the above Sold Secure standards, please contact us at support@stablemobility.io.","NOTE that if a lock you register is not found in our database, we will not be able to automatically determine your eligibility for StableCare, and therefore you will only be able to get a mock quote until your account has at least one StableCare-eligible lock registered thereto."]},{"l":"How to Become a StableCare Member","p":["The enumerated steps below outline the basic process of becoming a StableCare Member:","Download the Stable App ( Get it on Google Play, or on Apple TestFlight).","Within the Stable App, create a new account, or login to your existing Stable account.","Follow these account setup steps to register your vehicle and your lock to your Stable account.","To sign up for Membership, navigate to the( https://stablemobility.io/stablecare)StableCare icon on the navigation bar.

You cannot generate a referral code for your own quote, but if you refer other Members with your code, you will receive a $50 gift card for each referral that joins StableCare.","You will be presented with a quote containing multiple StableCare Membership options to select from, depending on the lock(s) you input when generating a quote. Until further notice, all quotes will be provided in United States Dollars only ( i.e., not available in other currencies). If you are not eligible for StableCare Diamond membership, you will still see a Diamond membership option, but it will be crossed out and unavailable to select.","You will be presented with three Membership durations, including Annual, Seasonal, or Passes.","Annual: Annual Membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts for a year from that date.","Seasonal: Seasonal membership begins on the date of purchase and lasts through November 1 of that year. Seasonal Membership quotes are prorated from the date of a quote, meaning the prices may change depending on how much time is left in the season.","Passes: Members can purchase single-use theft protection passes, or “Guardian Passes,” which can be purchased in packs of 5, 10, or 20, along with a StableCare Steel Membership. Guardian Passes are designed to provide affordable theft protection for riders who infrequently need theft protection, such as riders who typically bring their ride inside wherever they go. StableCare Steel Members must provide a refundable deposit to become a Member, which is automatically added as a line item to your invoice when you select a Guardian Pass pack.","Upon selecting your preferred StableCare tier* and duration, you will be directed to a checkout page on Stripe where you will make a one-time payment for the full length of the Membership tier you selected.

While we ask that Members complete these action items in a timely manner, the Member can decide if and when they choose to complete them. For example, if the Member wants to preserve their privacy, they can choose not to complete the Account Verification process unless and until they need to file a theft claim.","However, some of the action items may be difficult or impossible to complete after a theft incident, which if left incomplete would therefore make it effectively impossible for the Member to file a reviewable theft claim. For instance, the serial number for your vehicle associated with your Membership must be provided prior to submitting a theft claim. If you do not have a photo or other copy of the serial number of your vehicle, and it is stolen before you add the serial number to your Membership, then Company reserves the right to deny your claim. Company has designed the Stable App to provide ample reminders to Members with incomplete Memberships, and encourages all Members to complete their Memberships soon after becoming a StableCare Member."]},{"l":"Completing your Membership","p":["You will need to complete the following before you can submit a reviewable theft claim.","You will need to review and agree to the Terms and Conditions by checking a box and providing your signature in the Agree to Terms card on the screen.","You will need to Upload Proof of Purchase documentation for at least the vehicle covered under your Membership. We may also ask you to provide receipt(s) for your lock(s) and/or alarm (if you have one) by contacting you via email if Company deems it necessary to verify the coverage amount.","You will also need to provide your vehicle Serial Number if you have not already done so when registering your vehicle. This can be done at any time, but we recommend doing so right away, as it may be difficult or impossible to do if and after your vehicle gets stolen.","Upload an image of your lock(s) if you did not already do so when registering your lock.","If your Membership is incomplete, you will see a message on your home page within the Stable App that explains that your StableCare Membership is incomplete. When you view your StableCare Membership details, you will see a list of action items that you'll need to do before you complete your Membership. While you should always refer to these Terms to ensure your compliance with our requirements, we've designed the Stable App to guide you through these post-purchase requirements.","If you start your Membership and then subsequently upgrade your lock, buy a second lock enabling Alchemy, buy an alarm, etc., you can reach out to us at any time to have your StableCare Membership tier upgraded and to receive a dividend on your initial payment. If any of these steps are not completed prior to submitting a theft claim for reimbursement, Stable has the right to refuse to process the claim."]},{"l":"StableCare Requirements"},{"l":"Log Parking","p":["As part of StableCare Membership, you are required to log parking every time you lock your Micromobility Vehicle using the Stable App. Members are required to select their Membership when logging parking (which should occur automatically) to enjoy theft protection during that parking session. If Company discovers that a Member frequently parks without logging parking, Company may view such activity with suspicion, which may adversely impact the Member’s chances at having a future theft claim approved. For this reason, we highly encourage all Members to log parking each and every time that they lock up."]},{"l":"Verify your Identity","p":["Members are required to have a verified account in the Stable App to qualify for StableCare Membership benefits, such as the ability to submit a reviewable theft claim. You can verify your identity in the Stable App by visiting the Account tab and selecting the \"Verify Identity\" card. You will be guided through a process that includes phone verification, verifying a state-issued identification card, taking a self portrait, answering a few questions about your criminal history (if any), and asking you to sign an attestation.","In respect of your privacy, you can choose to verify your account only if/when you need to submit a theft claim under your StableCare Membership. We will not under any circumstances review or approve a theft claim unless and until you verify your identity."]},{"l":"Proper Claim Submission","p":["Members are required to properly file a claim as detailed in these Terms and Conditions. This includes filing a police report and submitting a copy to Stable, as well as all of the other detailed steps listed below."]},{"l":"Highly Encouraged Practices","p":["The following section describes a set of best practices that we highly encourage each Member to follow. Because StableCare is not insurance, the Company reserves the right to refuse claims that are submitted by members that are deemed fraudulent, dubious, or otherwise dishonest. To increase the likelihood that your claim is approved, we recommend that you adhere to the following practices."]},{"l":"Always Log Parking","p":["When you submit your claim, we first check to see if you satisfied all of the basic requirements. The first of these requirements is that you logged parking prior to the theft. Of course, this means that you could choose not to log parking sometimes, perhaps because you believe the risk to be low, because you’re in a hurry, or because you simply forgot. Because a thief can steal your vehicle any time you park, we strongly encourage that all members log parking every time they park. By making logging parking habitual, you ensure that you have at least satisfied this basic requirement if you become the unfortunate victim of theft."]},{"l":"Park at Stables as Much As Possible","p":["The most irrefutable evidence of theft is video footage of the theft occurring. Parking at Stables (that is, camera-monitored spots) increases the chance that you can obtain this video footage. For claims that appear suspicious—such as those filed soon after a member joins, or where the context of the situation is otherwise unusual or indicative of a potential fraudulent claim—security camera footage can be very convincing evidence that makes it significantly easier for the Company to approve of your claim. Moreover, thieves are less likely to commit crimes in camera-monitored areas, so parking at Stables should reduce the chance you’ll even fall victim to theft in the first place."]},{"l":"Map Stables for Other Members to Find","p":["If Stables are safer, more secure parking spots for micromobility vehicles, then we should discover and share them with others in the community. Members that map Stables are actively giving back to the micromobility community, and doing their part to encourage riders to replace more car trips with micromobility trips. When we process a claim, we examine how many Stables the member has mapped—and thereby consider how much this member has contributed to the micromobility community. Doing so is not required to be a StableCare Member, but members who actively map Stables will be considered with greater deference than members who don’t map Stables. Think of this like positive karma for contributing to the community. As an added bonus, you’ll be able to use Stable Tokens awarded for mapping Stables for various prizes and be entered into raffles!"]},{"l":"Use Multiple Locks","p":["If a thief is deciding which vehicle to steal, they will likely target whichever vehicle is easiest to steal. Using two or more locks—especially when parking in riskier areas—should significantly reduce your risk of theft. If you plan to use multiple locks, just make sure that one of those locks is the anchor lock that you used to register for StableCare! Remember that two locks that qualify for StableCare Gold create Alchemy and automatically make you eligible for StableCare Diamond!"]},{"l":"Get an Angle Grinder-Resistant Lock","p":["Modern angle grinders can cut through almost any lock in a matter of 5-10 seconds—except for angle-grinder resistant locks like the Litelok X1, Litelok X3, or Hiplok D1000. We believe these locks are a worthwhile investment, and will greatly reduce your risk of theft. Plus, you will be eligible for StableCare Diamond, which will reduce your cost for theft protection by 40%!"]},{"l":"Filing a Claim","p":["If you fall victim to theft during the course of your Membership, you can submit a theft claim to Company to request reimbursement for your stolen vehicle.","The moment you discover your vehicle has been stolen, open the Stable App and go to the StableCare tab.

Most police officers will tell you that there's not much they can do if the report filed the next day, as many thieves will bring the vehicle to a chop shop or will have sold it by then.","Wondering how to describe what happened to the police?

The National Insurance Crime Bureau reported that there were about 880,000 car thefts in the United States in 2020 out of about 275 million cars ( Statista).

If you have a bicycle or e-bike, you may be able to get theft insurance from an insurance carrier or broker that operates in your country or state.","Prepare for Theft","Apart from traditional \"insurance,\" there are other theft reimbursement policies. Perhaps the most well-known (and most controversial) theft insurance alternative is Kryptonite's Anti-Theft Protection Offer (ATPO), which is an optional program that you bicycle and e-bike owners can opt into when you buy certain Kryptonite locks that functions similarly to theft insurance. However, a quick Google search shows that riders all over the US have reported that claims processing results in frequent denials and is very slow, sometimes taking 5-6 months before getting any response from the company.","Although Kryptonite's ATPO Terms and Conditions state that they cover \"scooters\", we believe that it is highly unlikely that Kryptonite intended this to cover stand-up electric scooters. First, \"scooters\" fall under \"powersport\" vehicles, a category which encompasses gas-powered vehicles like ATVs and dirt bikes. Second, the Terms and Conditions were last updated in 2016—a year before the first shared e-scooters companies were founded. These factors suggest that e-scooters are NOT covered under Kryptonite's ATPO offer, and instead that the term \"scooter\" in Kryptonite terminology refers to the sit-down, moped-style scooters.","Whatever you decide to do, we strongly advise that you consider purchasing some form of theft insurance.

We may also take steps to anonymize certain data within set time periods.","Information retained until your Stable Account is deleted - we may keep some data for the life of your Stable Account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services.
