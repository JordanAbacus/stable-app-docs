Riders can get quotes for StableCare, purchase a StableCare membership, and log parking to enjoy theft protection under their StableCare Membership. For riders who already have insurance, the app allows you to discover and share camera-monitored parking spots, and to log parking sessions, both of which provide useful evidence to bolster your chances at a successful insurance claim if your vehicle gets stolen.","Even if you don't have theft coverage, we encourage all riders to use the app. As more people use it, we'll learn more about where thefts occur, which vehicles are most targeted, and which locks are most easily defeated—and are committed to sharing this info with you to help reduce the chances that you fall victim to theft."]},{"l":"Finding and Mapping Parking Spots","p":["The Stable App allows users to find and map parking spots for bicycles, personal electric vehicles (PEVs), and other micromobility vehicles."]},{"l":"Adding Unmapped Parking Spots","p":["If a user finds a parking spot—such as a bike rack or other immovable object—they can choose to add that parking spot to the map by Mapping a Stable.

A Stable is a parking spot that is within view of a security camera. Conversely, a Post(short for \"Hitching Post\") is a parking spot that is not within view of a security camera.","We are aware that, just because there is a security camera nearby, doesn't necessarily mean that it's operational, pointed at the parking spot, and that the owner is willing to share the footage. We are actively developing the process of verifying these details.","The reason we differentiate camera-monitored spots is simple: if your vehicle gets stolen, you ideally want to get video footage of the theft occurring— especially if you have theft insurance or another theft reimbursement coverage.","Video footage is the best proof you can get that you properly locked up your vehicle to an immovable object, and that the lock itself was defeated (picked/cut/etc.) by a thief—which are the most common requirements to filing a theft insurance or reimbursement claim."]},{"l":"Gathering Evidence","p":["In addition to helping riders find camera-monitored parking spots (Stables), the app also provides a painless way to Log Parking, which can be useful to prove that your vehicle was properly locked up prior to a theft occurring.","To log parking, the rider can open the Log Parking page and quickly snap a photo of your locked-up vehicle before walking away from it.

This includes going on long journeys, trekking through inclement weather, and hauling lots of cargo or your kids.","But for the majority of trips we take (especially in cities) a car is more often than not provides needless capacity. For internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, we burn excess fossil fuels to move a 4,000 lb car usually carrying only 1 person who weighs less than 5% the weight of their car.","And while EVs effectively emit less carbon than ICE cars, much of the energy from the grid used to charge them is derived from burning fossil fuels. Moreover, EVs inherit the same issue of their ICE counterparts—they are needlessly large and heavy, and thus consume power far in excess of what is needed to move their passenger.","Micromobility offers many benefits over automobility:","Faster trips: The average driving speed in most cities is under 15 mph. Most PEVs average more than this.","Reduced congestion: getting cars off the road reduces traffic (obviously!)","Less energy consumed: most PEVs fit the size of the rider and weigh well under 100 lbs.","Cleaner air: no tailpipe emissions!","Lower CO2 emissions: reduces the single biggest contributor to CO2 emissions: transportation","Environmental immersion: You experience the surrounding environment in a more connected way than in a car.","More fun: Riding through a city is just more fun on a micromobility vehicle!"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Signing up for an account in the Stable App"]},{"l":"Account Registration","p":["To create your account, first download the Stable App for iOS (open beta on TestFlight) or Android (open beta on Google Play Store).","You should now see the splash screen.","Click on the Register button to create a new account.

Try and make sure we can see the lock and how it is securing the vehicle to the object that you're locking to.","There are a few basic requirements for your vehicle to be protected during your parking session.","Your vehicle must be properly locked up. If someone can separate your vehicle from your lock(s) without picking the lock(s), using any tools, or substantially disassembling the vehicle, then your vehicle is not properly locked up. Proper lock-ups can only be defeated by using specialized tools, like angle grinders, to defeat your lock(s).","Your vehicle must be locked to a substantially immovable object, such as a bike rack. If the bike rack is not bolted/cemented to the ground, but is big and heavy such that it would require multiple people to lift and steal the bike rack with your vehicle attached to it, then it's substantially immovable. We're not going to deny you on a technicality here; but if the object you lock to can be easily moved or destroyed ( e.g., a wooden post, a very rusty street sign, a small object that can be moved by removing a few common bolts or screws, etc.), we may deny your claim.","You cannot lock up your vehicle unattended for very long periods of time. For now, we plan on only providing coverage for parking sessions up to 12 hours long. If you need coverage for specific extended cases ( e.g., parking at the airport for more than 12 hours), feel free to reach out to us and ask about your specific case at hello@stablemobility.io- we'll let you know if we will cover it.","For a more thorough explanation of the requirements, see our Terms and Conditions."]},{"i":"what-kinds-of-memberships-are-available","l":"What kinds of memberships are available?","p":["$","$$","$$$","Annual, Seasonal*","At this time, we only offer monthly memberships on a case-by-case basis, based on financial need.

Depending on the city you live in, as high as 87% of all thefts occur between April and October.","Source: BikeNapped"]},{"l":"About the Sold Secure grades","p":["Sold Secure ratings indicate a lock's level of resistance to attacks. Somewhat confusingly, Sold Secure ratings are also separated based on the type of vehicle.","Previously, Sold Secure had \"bicycle\"-class gradings and \"motorcycle\"-class gradings. Due to the recent explosion in personal electric vehicle types, Sold Secure has done away with the bicycle/motorcycle paradigm and shifted to a \"pedal\"-class and \"powered\"-class paradigm instead. In the process, they reclassified a number of locks, in part because a lot of locks can be used for both acoustic bicycles and PEVs.","If you examine the locks in the Sold Secure Gold (Pedal), Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal), and Sold Secure Gold (Powered) categories, you'll see that all of them require special tools to defeat, and thus protect against attacks from run-of-the-mill thieves without specialized power tools. From our research, we concluded that the differences in protection across these three Sold Secure categories is roughly the same. In other words, Sold Secure Gold (Pedal) locks offer about the same protection as Sold Secure Diamond (Pedal) and Sold Secure Gold (Powered).","In contrast, Sold Secure Diamond (Powered) includes locks that are highly resistant to angle grinder attacks, such as the Litelok X1, Litelok X3, and Hiplok D1000. These locks are significantly more secure than the lower categories, requiring multiple angle grinder discs and at least 5-10 minutes of continuous cutting to defeat.

If you have an expensive e-bike or e-scooter, Diamond tier memberships can save you a lot of money on your membership!","Just like with Gold tier, we offer annual and seasonal memberships at the Diamond tier. If you ride year-round, the annual membership is probably the right choice for you. If you only ride during the warmer months of the year, or don't park outside during the winter months, then a seasonal membership can save you some money."]},{"l":"Steel","p":["StableCare Steel Memberships are designed for riders who usually bring their ride inside with them wherever they go, but occasionally have to park outside. Instead of providing coverage each time you log parking, StableCare Steel members must use a Guardian Pass to get theft protection during their parking session. The price of the Guardian Pass depends on the amount of coverage you want. If you only park outside occasionally and don't want to pay for unlimited parking session coverage, StableCare Steel can be a more affordable option for you.","Steel Memberships have the same lock requirement as Gold Memberships: your lock must be Sold Secure Gold (Pedal) or better."]},{"i":"looking-for-other-coverage-options","l":"Looking for other coverage options?","p":["In collaboration with our members, we are actively expanding our coverage options to give fair and affordable coverage for a variety of circumstances.

If you put in the sale price of the vehicle, and that sale later ends and the price goes up, then your elected coverage amount might not cover the cost of the replacement vehicle.","While insurance companies typically ask you to select a deductible amount, we instead ask you to elect how much coverage you want. The rate for an insurance policy typically decreases as you have a higher deductible amount because you are technically receiving less coverage.

Without getting too philosophical, we've designed the claims process to be collaborative, not adversarial.","All that being said, you could choose not to log parking, but be aware that we may ask you for supplemental evidence to prove that you properly locked up your e-scooter or e-bike to a substantially immovable object in the event of a theft. In our opinion, the tradeoff of taking 5-10 seconds to log parking is worth the increased certainty as to the outcome of your claim, but we know that not everyone sees it this way!"]},{"i":"what-happens-if-i-forget-to-log-parking-does-that-invalidate-my-theft-protection","l":"What happens if I forget to log parking? Does that invalidate my theft protection?","p":["Absolutely not! You do not have to log parking every time you park your e-scooter or e-bike. And we know that it's easy to forget sometimes—especially if theft isn't top of mind when you park somewhere.","We will not penalize you in any way for parking and not logging it—but, if you forget to log it, you won't have that key piece of evidence if your vehicle happens to get stolen that time. So we recommend making it a habit, especially if you plan to leave your vehicle unattended for longer than 5-10 minutes."]},{"l":"Claims"},{"i":"how-does-the-claim-process-work","l":"How does the claim process work?","p":["The claims process is pretty straightforward.","If you discover that your micromobility vehicle is stolen, go into the app and report it as stolen by visiting your membership page and tapping on the \"Activate Benefit\" button. As of the current app version, the only benefit we've implemented in the app is submitting a claim for reimbursement (but we are working on adding other benefits, like getting reimbursed for an Uber/Lyft/taxi home, etc.).","Next, file a police report. Some police departments have forms that you can fill out online, and others require that you call their non-emergency number and ask to file a police report. We can help you with the script of what to tell them/enter into an online form.","Get a copy of the report and upload it in the app under your membership (when you initiate a claim, a \"Theft Claim\" section appears under your membership with a button to upload the police report). If you only receive a case number or other reference to the police report, that's fine too—just email us to let us know.","That's all that we require on your end; it shouldn't take any more than 5-10 minutes of your time. Since we ask riders to log parking in the app when they park their micromobility vehicle away from home, we should already have photo evidence that you locked up, so we don't need a lengthy write up or explanation of what happened.","If you need help with any of the steps, just reach out to us at support@stablemobility.io! We see the claims process as a collaboration and want to help you as much as possible (we want people to share good experiences with us, not bad ones!).","We then review your claim to verify that it was stolen, and check that you filed a police report. Our goal is to complete this process within 24 hours in the vast majority of cases.","If we approve your claim, we will contact you about how you want to be reimbursed for your loss—either by buying you a replacement scooter (and any lock/accessories you might have had covered), or by transferring funds to you based on the amount of coverage that you asked for."]},{"i":"how-quickly-do-you-review-claims","l":"How quickly do you review claims?","p":["Once you have completed all of the requirements claim (reported in the app, file the police report, and upload a copy of the police report in the app), we will review it within 1 business day, if not the same day. At that point, we will make one of a few determinations:","Approved: Your claim has been approved. We will contact you via the email you signed up with to propose an approach for how to replace your stolen items, and ask for your preferred shipping address. You may ask for a cash payout instead, and if so we will ask a few follow-questions (see the Qs and As below for more information).","Need More Info: We have reviewed your claim and determined that we need more information from you to process the claim. For example, if you file a claim for a theft incident that occurred during a parking session for which you forgot to log parking in the app, we will ask you to upload additional evidence in the app to prove that your vehicle was properly secured, such as pictures of the broken lock, security video footage of the theft occurring, or anything else that you believe will be useful to demonstrate that you complied with our Terms. We will reach out to you via email to request specific info or supplemental evidence to help us process your claim.","Denied: Your claim has been denied. We will contact you via the email you signed up with to explain why we denied your claim. At this point, you have an opportunity to appeal by emailing us back and making the case as to why our reasoning was flawed and/or presenting additional facts that you believe will help your case. We want to learn the truth of what happened, and would prefer to work with you to better understand what happened rather than deny your claim outright with an incomplete understanding of what happened.","We will only ask for additional evidence when the circumstances are unusual or the claim appears to be an attempt to commit fraud. If you park and log it in the app regularly, and you did so before the theft incident, we will almost certainly not ask for additional evidence. Here are a few scenarios where we might ask for additional evidence:","The photo you took when you logged parking is blurry, has poor lighting, or is otherwise very difficult to discern whether your vehicle was even locked up.","You forgot to log parking before the theft incident, and so there's no photo evidence that your vehicle was properly secured before the theft occurred.","You file a claim very soon after you purchase your membership (since this is statistically unlikely, we will naturally treat such claims with healthy suspicion).","You file a claim for a theft incident that doesn't involve locking up, such as if you are robbed while riding, if you claim someone broke into your house/apartment, etc."]},{"i":"how-do-you-pay-out-claims","l":"How do you pay out claims?","p":["Once we have approved your claim, we will coordinate with you to purchase a new micromobility vehicle of the same make and model, and have it shipped to your address. If you also elected to get coverage for your lock(s) and/or accessories, we will order replacements for them as well. We'll try to order these items within 48 hours of approving your claim, if not sooner.","How quickly you receive these items depends on whether they are in stock and the shipping times for each item. We cannot make any guarantees about delivery dates relative to when you file a claim or relative to when we order the replacement items.","If any of the replacement items are on backorder, are discontinued, or are otherwise not available within a reasonable time frame, we will work with you to determine a suitable alternative(s) at a comparable price. For example, if the lock you had was discontinued and a replacement lock is only $10 more expensive, we'll go ahead an order it for you! If no suitable alternatives are available, then we will work with you to determine how to transfer funds to you in the amount of your elected coverage less the cost of replacing your vehicle and/or other items, if any."]},{"i":"why-do-you-prefer-to-purchase-replacement-items-instead-of-just-paying-out-cash","l":"Why do you prefer to purchase replacement items instead of just paying out cash?","p":["First, we expect that the reason that you purchased theft protection was so that, in the event of a theft, you are able to replace what was lost without having to pay for everything out-of-pocket. As such, it makes the most sense to order you the replacement parts.","Second, we want to try and replace everything you lost at no additional cost to you, if possible. For example, if you elected for $1,000 in coverage, but it turns out that replacing everything would cost $1,100, we would be be happy to buy the items even though the cost to us exceeds the coverage amount you elected. In other words, when buying replacement items, we will cover costs above your elected coverage amount if the cost reasonably exceeds the elected coverage amount.","If the cost to replace your stolen items far exceeds the elected coverage amount, then we'll work with you to determine what item(s) you want replaced, if any, and will transfer the remaining amount to you in your preferred method of payment. For example, if you only elected for $1,000 on an $1,800 e-scooter, then we will work with you to determine whether you want to get a replacement e-scooter that's approximately $1,000, or if you want $1,000 in cash sent to you to put toward your next e-scooter (i.e., to allow you to buy a used replacement at a discount, or just to put toward a replacement scooter.","Third, we prefer to purchase replacement items for you because we expect that people who will attempt to commit fraud will do so specifically to get a cash payout. We don't want to support thieves and fraudsters in any way, and we certainly don't want our customers membership payments being used to pay them out! As such, we approach any request for cash payout only with a reasonable amount of suspicion.","That being said, we know that there are many legitimate reasons why someone would prefer a cash payout instead of replacement items (e.g., your items have been discontinued or have a long lead time, your stolen scooter had serious quality issues and you wouldn't buy a second one, you want to upgrade to a newer scooter, you're experiencing hardship and needing the money more than the scooter, etc.). If you will only accept a cash payout, then we will likely ask you follow up questions to understand the reason you don't want replacements instead."]},{"l":"Multiple Vehicles"},{"i":"do-you-offer-discounts-for-multiple-vehicles","l":"Do you offer discounts for multiple vehicles?","p":["Yes, we offer steep discounts for StableCare plans for additional vehicles.","Currently, multi-vehicle discounts are not yet built into the app or the quoting engine.

Or should I get a single quote with a combined coverage amount?","p":["You should get a separate quote for each vehicle. We understand that this is a bit cumbersome, and are working on improving the product experience for riders with multiple vehicles.","Conceptually, think of each vehicle as having its own coverage. If you have a Ninebot Max and a Vsett 11+, each of them would be covered under their own respective StableCare memberships. For now, get a quote, complete the checkout process, and set up the membership for each vehicle.","If this all sounds too cumbersome, we are here to help! Just reach out to support@stablemobility.io for assistance.

Thus, we expect that you will only park one of them away from home at a time.","This means that you can only get theft coverage away from home for one of your vehicles at a time. This means that if you let a friend or family borrow one of your covered vehicles, only the vehicle you ride and park will be covered.","For theft coverage at or near home, all vehicles are covered all the time.

Check out the section on shared vehicles below for more info."]},{"i":"can-i-use-the-same-lock-s-for-multiple-covered-vehicles","l":"Can I use the same lock(s) for multiple covered vehicles?","p":["Absolutely! You can use the same lock for multiple covered vehicles, so long as you don't ever need to lock up both vehicles at the same time.","For example, if you own two e-scooters and bring both of them indoors to your house or apartment's living space, then you share the same lock for both vehicles because (1) you don't need to lock up at home, and (2) you will only be riding and parking one of your e-scooters away from home at a time.","However, say that you own two e-bikes and store them in a back yard or patio (i.e., in a non-living space area at or near home). When at home, we require that you lock up your vehicle. Thus, you'd need a separate lock for each e-bike, since there's no way that you can have both of them locked at the same time with the same lock (especially when you ride one of the e-bikes away from home)."]},{"l":"Shared Vehicles"},{"i":"i-share-a-covered-vehicle-with-a-friend-family-member-or-significant-other-and-still-enjoy-theft-protection-under-my-stablecare-membership","l":"I share a covered vehicle with a friend, family member, or significant other, and still enjoy theft protection under my StableCare membership?","p":["Generally, no, we only offer theft protection when you (the Member) rides and parks your vehicle. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.","First, if your friend rides your vehicle, locks it up, and you log parking for them (e.g., you rode with them on a different vehicle that is not covered by StableCare), then your vehicle is covered for that parking session. This assumes that you're not parking another StableCare-covered vehicle yourself and therefore want simultaneous coverage for multiple vehicles.","Second, if we have manually approved your membership to be shared between two or more accounts (such that separate users can log parking with the same membership), any one of the members associated with the membership can log parking and enjoy theft protection. For example, if you and your significant other share an e-bike, we can link the same membership to both of your accounts, enabling either of you to ride and park protected under the same StableCare membership.","Third, if you have multiple StableCare-covered vehicles and have received explicit approval from Stable to share your vehicle, then of course your vehicle would be protected if someone else rode and parked it. The only requirement in this case is either that you (the Member) log parking, or that the person borrowing your StableCare-covered vehicle downloads our app, makes an account, and logs parking under their account. In the event that the vehicle gets stolen during that parking session, you (the Member) would need to share information about who logged parking so we could look up the parking record on our end to verify that the vehicle was properly locked to a substantially immovable object."]},{"i":"is-there-a-way-for-me-to-share-a-stablecare-membership-in-the-app","l":"Is there a way for me to share a StableCare membership in the app?","p":["Not yet.

If the area is monitored by a security camera and the Member has access to getting security video footage from it, the Member does not have to log parking at home, and can instead obtain and share the security footage in the event of a theft.","If a Member parks their vehicle at home in a non-publicly accessible non-living space, such as a private garage with all entryways shut and locked, then the Member does not need to lock up and, in turn, does not need to log parking. In the event of a theft of a Member's non-locked vehicle in a non-publicly accessible non-living space, Stable will likely request Member to provide photographic evidence of forcible entry, such as a broken door, shattered window, or other signs of forcible entry.

StableCare may cover theft scenarios where the thief damaged the object to which the vehicle was locked on a case-by-case basis. StableCare may also cover theft scenarios where the thief damaged the vehicle itself in order to free it from the lock.","StableCare does not cover scenarios where theft was achieved through the minor disassembly of the vehicle ( e.g., when the lock is secured to the stem of a scooter and the thief removed the handle bars and slid the stem out of the lock). If a thief can relatively easily disassemble parts of the vehicle to separate the vehicle from the lock, the lock-up is considered improper and therefore is not covered by StableCare, with exceptions made by the Company on a case-by-case basis.","If common tools (e.g., flathead screwdriver, philips screwdriver, hex wrench, adjustable wrench, etc.) can be used to disassemble parts of your vehicle within a reasonably short amount of time (e.g., under 5 minutes), such that a thief could free the vehicle from the lock, then such disassembly shall be deemed minor.","If specialized tools (e.g., security screwdriver, power tools, etc.) are required to disassemble parts of your vehicle such that a thief could free the vehicle from the lock, then such disassembly shall be deemed major.","Although Company will endeavour to extend coverage to all cases in which thieves disassemble parts of the vehicle, the onus is on the Member to understand how their vehicle's construction and determine which lock-up configurations could be overcome through minor vehicle disassembly. For example, many handlebar assemblies on e-scooters are secured to the stem with a few bolts or screws.

The National Insurance Crime Bureau reported that there were about 880,000 car thefts in the United States in 2020 out of about 275 million cars ( Statista). This equates to about a 0.29% theft rate, indicating that the rate of bicycle theft is likely 15-20x higher than the rate of car theft."]},{"i":"what-about-pevs","l":"What about PEVs?","p":["While these odds aren't great, they are probably even worse for personal electric vehicles (PEVs).","Various sources such as the National Bicycle Dealers Association report that most non-speciality bicycles are priced between $100 and $300. Compare that to e-bikes, which have an average price of about $2,000.","It's no surprise that early studies are reporting that the theft rate for much more valuable e-bikes is about 3 times greater than for cheaper self-powered bicycles."]},{"i":"what-do-these-odds-mean-for-you","l":"What do these odds mean for you?","p":["While we don't currently know the true theft rates for bike and PEV theft, the approximate rates are high enough that you will probably fall victim to theft if you own and use a micromobility vehicle for enough time."]},{"l":"How to prepare for theft","p":["If we consider that theft is not a matter of if, but rather a matter of when, then the smartest thing we can do is prepare for it. We recommend that you do the following:","Invest in a good lock.","Get theft insurance or another theft reimbursement policy.","Choose good parking spots","Register the serial number with one or more bicycle registries.","Consider other anti-theft measures, such as a GPS tracker, motion-activated alarm, etc..","Securely store info about your vehicle, such as clear photo(s) of it and the serial number.","Use multiple locks in risky situations.","If you're buying a used vehicle, do some basic diligence to ensure it wasn't stolen."]},{"l":"1. Invest in a good lock","p":["Locks are the primary line of defense against theft. The most secure locks are typically U-locks and chain locks.

Get theft insurance or another theft reimbursement policy.","p":["If theft is inevitable, then insurance is the only complete solution to the problem. If you have a bicycle or e-bike, you may be able to get theft insurance from an insurance carrier or broker that operates in your country or state.","Prepare for Theft","Apart from traditional \"insurance,\" there are other theft reimbursement policies. Perhaps the most well-known (and most controversial) theft insurance alternative is Kryptonite's Anti-Theft Protection Offer (ATPO), which is an optional program that you bicycle and e-bike owners can opt into when you buy certain Kryptonite locks that functions similarly to theft insurance. However, a quick Google search shows that riders all over the US have reported that claims processing results in frequent denials and is very slow, sometimes taking 5-6 months before getting any response from the company.","Although Kryptonite's ATPO Terms and Conditions state that they cover \"scooters\", we believe that it is highly unlikely that Kryptonite intended this to cover stand-up electric scooters. First, \"scooters\" fall under \"powersport\" vehicles, a category which encompasses gas-powered vehicles like ATVs and dirt bikes. Second, the Terms and Conditions were last updated in 2016—a year before the first shared e-scooters companies were founded. These factors suggest that e-scooters are NOT covered under Kryptonite's ATPO offer, and instead that the term \"scooter\" in Kryptonite terminology refers to the sit-down, moped-style scooters.","Whatever you decide to do, we strongly advise that you consider purchasing some form of theft insurance. Almost every lock on the market can be cut with an angle grinder with ease, so there's nothing that can fully protect your investment in your vehicle other than theft insurance or theft reimbursement.","Check out our article on theft insurance policies for some more info."]},{"l":"3.

The first of these requirements is that you logged parking prior to the theft. Of course, this means that you could choose not to log parking sometimes, perhaps because you believe the risk to be low, because you’re in a hurry, or because you simply forgot. Because a thief can steal your vehicle any time you park, we strongly encourage that all members log parking every time they park. By making logging parking habitual, you ensure that you have at least satisfied this basic requirement if you become the unfortunate victim of theft."]},{"l":"Park at Stables as Much As Possible","p":["The most irrefutable evidence of theft is video footage of the theft occurring. Parking at Stables (that is, camera-monitored spots) increases the chance that you can obtain this video footage. For claims that appear suspicious—such as those filed soon after a member joins, or where the context of the situation is otherwise unusual or indicative of a potential fraudulent claim—security camera footage can be very convincing evidence that makes it significantly easier for the Company to approve of your claim. Moreover, thieves are less likely to commit crimes in camera-monitored areas, so parking at Stables should reduce the chance you’ll even fall victim to theft in the first place."]},{"l":"Map Stables for Other Members to Find","p":["If Stables are safer, more secure parking spots for micromobility vehicles, then we should discover and share them with others in the community. Members that map Stables are actively giving back to the micromobility community, and doing their part to encourage riders to replace more car trips with micromobility trips. When we process a claim, we examine how many Stables the member has mapped—and thereby consider how much this member has contributed to the micromobility community.
