Over time, this community-driven effort will build out a map of parking spots to help other riders in their neighborhood or city find parking that meets their needs."]},{"l":"Finding Mapped Parking Spots","p":["Users can also look for parking spots that others have previously mapped on the map view.

A Stable is a parking spot that is within view of a security camera. Conversely, a Post(short for \"Hitching Post\") is a parking spot that is _ not_ within view of a security camera.","We are aware that, just because there is a security camera nearby, doesn't necessarily mean that it's operational, pointed at the parking spot, and that the owner is willing to share the footage. We are actively developing the process of verifying these details.","The reason we differentiate camera-monitored spots is simple: if your vehicle gets stolen, you ideally want to get video footage of the theft occurring— especially if you have theft insurance or another theft reimbursement coverage.","Video footage is the best proof you can get that you properly locked up your vehicle to an immovable object, and that the lock itself was defeated (picked/cut/etc.) by a thief—which are the most common requirements to filing a theft insurance or reimbursement claim."]},{"l":"Gathering Evidence","p":["In addition to helping riders find camera-monitored parking spots (Stables), the app also provides a painless way to Log Parking, which can be useful to prove that your vehicle was properly locked up prior to a theft occurring.","To log parking, the rider can open the Log Parking page and quickly snap a photo of your locked-up vehicle before walking away from it. The app securely stores a record of the parking, including:","the photo of your locked-up vehicle","its location","the current date and time","info about the registered vehicle, including a photo of the vehicle and its serial number (if you chose to register them)","the registered lock","In the event of a theft, you can easily obtain this information by having the parking record emailed to yourself, or by emailing us at records@stablemobility.io"]},{"i":"why-should-i-log-parking","l":"Why should I log parking?","p":["If your vehicle gets stolen and you need to file a claim with insurance (or a company offering you a form of theft protection/reimbursement), we can provide you with a verified copy of the parking record.

This includes going on long journeys, trekking through inclement weather, and hauling lots of cargo or your kids.","But for the majority of trips we take (especially in cities) a car is more often than not provides needless capacity. For internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, we burn excess fossil fuels to move a 4,000 lb car usually carrying only 1 person who weighs less than 5% the weight of their car.","And while EVs effectively emit less carbon than ICE cars, much of the energy from the grid used to charge them is derived from burning fossil fuels. Moreover, EVs inherit the same issue of their ICE counterparts—they are needlessly large and heavy, and thus consume power far in excess of what is needed to move their passenger.","Micromobility offers many benefits over automobility:","Faster trips: The average driving speed in most cities is under 15 mph. Most PEVs average more than this.","Reduced congestion: getting cars off the road reduces traffic (obviously!)","Less energy consumed: most PEVs fit the size of the rider and weigh well under 100 lbs.","Cleaner air: no tailpipe emissions!","Lower CO2 emissions: reduces the single biggest contributor to CO2 emissions: transportation","Environmental immersion: You experience the surrounding environment in a more connected way than in a car.","More fun: Riding through a city is just more fun on a micromobility vehicle!"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Signing up for an account in the Stable App"]},{"l":"Account Registration","p":["To create your account, first download the Stable App for iOS or Android ( not yet published).","You should now see the splash screen.","Click on the Register button to create a new account.
